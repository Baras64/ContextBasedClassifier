"my son y asked me today if there were a kind of a fireman s pole from the moon down to the earth , how long would it take to slide all the way from the moon to the earth ?"
"the earth s surface spins faster than the moon goes around , so the end that dangled down to the earth would break off if you tried to connect it to the ground"

"if you stood next to the end of the pole on the moon , a problem would become clear right away you have to slide up the pole , and that s not how sliding works"

"if you get up to escape velocity , then at the last minute remember that you need to slow down , you ll be in for an unpleasant surprise as you try to grab on to the pole"
"the lowest speed of the next cycle will be on may st , , so if you want to wait until to slide down , you can hit the atmosphere when the pole is moving at only m s relative to the earth s surface"

"so if , for some reason , your plan to take over the world doesn t work out , your stink will be all over him"
all would be forgiven if you just told the truth

just like my bobby would have looked if he d grown up
"if you re gonna bring a gun , you gotta bring enough gun"
"well , i ll check with the bank and maybe the post office , if they lost it or something"
"i mean , if you re planning on giving me some bowl winder about getting right with jesus by turning myself in not really"
what the hell is this ? damned if i know
i said that if eventually i have enough good ones that maybe i ll try and publish another collection
"well , you can dress up like a faggot if you want"
"well what if we rented one of those self storage places , you know , those little orange garages , worked out of there ? no"
"listen if you ve gone crazy or something i mean , if you ve if you ve gone crazy or depressed , i m just saying that s something i need to know about"
so how are those feeling in the waist ? are they too tight ? cause you don t want to get em if they re too tight
"you should get em if you like em , okay ? why don t you just hang out here for a second ? i ll be right back"
how about you come work for me ? i d be willing to sell it to you if the price is right
"are you happy with your current long distance service ? cause if you re not , i would definitely , really love to talk to you as soon as possible about hello ? hello"
and i would appreciate if you don t call here anymore
"it would therefore seem to follow that he is capable of acting out of mutual self interest , yes ? what ? do you think he is capable of listening to reason ? what kind of reason ? like dear krazy , listen , if i let you go , will you promise not to come back and waste my family ? no colombian neckties"
"but what if he s faking it ? like if it was me , i d be all faking being knocked out , yo ! and then , when the coast is clear , i d be up looking for weapons and shit , waiting to pounce ! now if it was me , and i couldn t find a decent enough weapon , i would just lie back down , and bide my time"
not even if you took him to the hospital right now
"now , if it was me , i would just try and think of it like i was i was doing him a favor"
"let me see if they re done with the blood sugar , then we ll get you out"
not if i have to
"i was just wondering if it maybe could you know , it s just a character thing i m stuck on"
what else did he tell you ? pretty much everything you can think of
"so i should just let you go , then ? just unlock you and adios , huh ? i don t see what real choice you have if it s between that and cold blooded murder"
"you ever smoke anything else , wendy ? sausages don t count"
"let him live it s the moral thing to do won t be able to live with yourself murder is wrong ! kill him , he ll kill you entire family if you let him go hello"
yeah ? because that d be the way to do it if you re gonna do it
"that s sunday , right ? i d rather call you that , if you don t mind"
"so , domingo are you from around town here or someplace else ? walter , you getting to know me is not gonna make it easier for you to kill me"
"i guess i d start off by promising that , if you let me go , i won t come after you"
so what else can i tell you ? i don t know
"hell , i ll write you a check right now if you let me go"
"if this here s a trap car , it s gonna take more than your dumb white ass to find it"
"we re sending it off to quantico , see if they can pull something off it"
and i think everybody would like it if you d stop saying that
"i m gonna see if i can talk him into , i don t know , joining us"
"yo , if you re not into sharing , man , just tell us to piss off"
i m right outside if you need me
"so maybe on condition , you know ? if he agrees to attend ? i just don t know what to tell jake"
"you know , i could wash those clothes if you d like"
"i mean , if you ever , like , i don t know , need advice"
"i m just saying , if you ever saw your way clear to you know , you and i cooking a little more"
"walt ! when it came right down to it , i didn t know what else to do but tell him the truth"
we forgot our ids and we were wondering if you could do us a favor and buy us a six pack
"if the other guys hadn t run , i could ve talked my way out of it"
"if this daddy warbucks wants to chip in , i m with your old lady on this one"
"what if you gave up on me , huh ? this here ? all the stuff i ve been through , and you re scared of a little chemotherapy ? me , personally ? i think you should do whatever you want to do"
he s not gonna have a future if he doesn t get treatment
"but what good is it , to just survive if i am too sick to work , to enjoy a meal , to make love ? for what time i have left , i want to live in my own house"
"i m only saying that , i d be okay with it , really , if you want to go"
call if the discomfort s too much
"but if a reaction happens quickly , otherwise harmless substances can interact in a way that generates enormous bursts of energy"
"what s up with that ? walt , is there anything else you re holding back from your family ? now s the time to share"
"if you have any questions , i ll be right out here"
let me know if you need anything
"you mind if i take a look at your storeroom ? not at all , no"
don t mind if i call you hugo hugo
"yeah , well , nothing personal , walt , but you wouldn t know a criminal if he was close enough to check you for a hernia"
"if you have any questions , now would be the time"
of course you would have known that if you would have just asked me
isn t there anything else we could be doing ? i ve been wondering about alternative medicine
"you mind if i have one ? you think it s a good idea ? hank , i ve already got lung cancer"
"you know , if we were drinking this in , we d be breaking the law"
"i mean , if you re okay with it"
"if this is all they had , wrong place"
"have you been listening to the words coming out of your mouth ? what would you do if it were me ? what do you mean if it were you ? if it were me , what would you do ? would you divorce me ? would you turn me in to the police ? you don t want to find out"
"if he wanted to kill us , he would ve at the junkyard"
"now , is there anyone else there ? i mean , tuco is usually with someone else , right ? maybe even a couple of guys"
"well , aren t you early bird , up and out already ? the big lug and i are gonna go try that new restaurant over by unm tonight so let me know if you guys wanna hang"
"do you think that people in china ever just feel like american ? you know , and they go out and get little takeout boxes with mashed potatoes and meat loaf and try and figure out how to use the little knives and forks ? i wonder if that ever happens"
i can t help it if you got your days of the week wrong
how would he know where i live ? you sure it was tuco ? who else could it be ? did you ever tell him my name ? no
but if you could do me this huge favour and just return her phone calls
"if i thought you were gonna return it , i would have never , you know"
not if tuco kills us first
not if you leave town
"hey , do you mind if i get in there ? no , go ahead"
you don t think he ? holler if you need me
"nothing else missing ? his keys , wallet , cell phone"
"i mean couldn t that be important , right ? anything else you can think of ? anything else"
i was actually hoping that you had something else being that you re the expert
"and if he doesn t go , i don t go"
i got my cell if you need me
"well , i mean , if he you know"
"well , then if that s the case , he must have a second phone"
"well , if you could put me in touch with your son"
if you could tell me one more thing
"is jesse still driving the chevy monte carlo , as far as you know ? if he had spent half as much time and money on his education as he has on that ridiculous bouncing car"
"specifically , i wanna know if the car s got a lojack"
"if so , can you go ahead and get me a fix on it ? thanks , buddy"
"if tuco didn t kill gonzo , then who did ? i don t know"
does it really matter ? if he finds out that gonzo is dead and not a police informant who does he automatically blame ? us
"nothing else ? no fleeting images ? well , no"
"since we re talking about missing property , did you ? did you leave anything else in the car ? like what ? like what ? like"
"now if this is truly necessary , can t i continue as an outpatient ? walt a fugue state is a very serious event"
what if you were to disassociate while driving ? get into a situation where you could be shot by the police ? we can t allow you to leave until we re certain what happened was a non recurring event
the exception would be if you threatened to kill someone
"if it weren t for that , none of this would ve happened"
"i mean , i ll go with you if you like"
you were wondering if i had a second cell phone
"and , well , the weird thing is that the alarm sound is almost exactly the same as the regular phone ring which is really a poor design if you ask me"
"you know , if we do this thing at unm , maybe on the way home we can stop by , and i can get a new cell phone"
"hey , how about this ? what if it s just for tonight ? wait"
"i just what if skyler had seen you ? what then ? what was the plan then , genius , huh ? i don t know"
"we ll check back in two months , see how you ve responded reassess and decide our next move , if any"
"and if it s all copacetic , i ll call"
"dude , i got nowhere else to go"
"if you blow this , i want you gone"
"why are we cooking when we can t even move what we cook ? well , how much do you think you can sell on your own ? say if i cook during the days and you work the nights"
"all right , so how about we get , you know , down to it ? there s some refreshments over here if you wanna partake"
"and second who else is selling right now , huh ? it s dry out there , that s for sure"
"did you really think it was all just neatly gonna go away ? well , if you hadn t tried to return it apologise"
"why are you punishing me ? if you don t respect me enough to apologise , to tell me the truth , then i need my sister back"
there s another one in the freezer if you want it
if you re looking for a reason not to go do this thing
"and , folks , the knock out is only hey , yo , is anybody else home ? now , terry put this one together where s your folks ? they here ? and i m here to tell you yeah , guys , you might wanna put up lik e a"
"call me if you can , whenever s convenient"

"if you want your hand to stop aching i gave you advice , take it or leave it"
"yeah , diesel this thing would go easier if we all had a little taste , man"
"was that a lie ? if you won t take our money , and your insurance isn t covering it how are you paying for it ? this is not an issue that concerns you , gretchen , okay ? excuse me , walt"

"i m just saying , you know , if you were selling i could maybe do with a teenth"

"i mean , what if , god forbid that they decide to take revenge ? what have you been telling him ? the kid keeps spouting off about , lf i talk , they ll kill me"
"if he does , you re dead"
"why don t you just kill badger ? i mean , follow me , but if a mosquito is buzzing around you and it bites you on the ass , you don t go gunning for the mosquito s attorney"
"okay , so if a prison shanking is completely off the table"
"you did bring the cash , didn t you ? look , if this option is too expensive you can still alwaysbadger in the chow line"
"if they see me , we re screwed"
"and if i can find you , how far behind can the cops be ? i don t understand"
"food for thought , yeah ? so if you wanna make more money and keep the money that you make better call saul !"
"if she finds out , it s after i m gone"

"oh , okay , so i totally just misread your total dis ? if anything , i was doing you a favour"
is the whole house gonna collapse or something ? not if i can help it

"let me make some calls , see if i can get you a meeting"
"the c section ? and if it s a yes , we need to schedule it"

"what else is there ? there s always , hey , i found a big bag of money down by the railroad tracks"
"oh , hell , i d be mad too if somebody owed me bucks"

"well , do they have to be diapers for newborns ? what if we went up a size and just kind of"

"he copped to it , didn t he ? for an extra pudding cup every night at los lunas ? maybe if you give him a pack of cigarettes he ll tell you what he did with jimmy hoffa"
"almost as if somebody wised up , stopped shitting where they eat"
"but if not , saul will take care of things"
"but i thought , you know , if it s good enough for the journal then why not tv ? so i went for it"

"i can t help you get through this , skyler , you know , if you won t tell me what it is that walt did"
"well , you know what ? i don t i don t remember asking you , all right ? well , i think that s so if you want to be supportive , the reason you re stuck"

"if you know of anything , you might wanna my my name s walter jr"
"like like what , you you can t even say his name ? um , if you ve changed your mind about being called flynn , all you need to do is just tell me that you don t want to be called flynn"

"maybe if we could , um trade"

"uh , i m just wondering if we should maybe call the police or something"
"you want just north of , milligrams per liter , but if you over boil to get there , you re going to leach your tannins"
"consenting adults want what they want , and if i m not supplying it , they will get it somewhere else"
"do you remember if this pinkman kid ever had an rv ? you know , a recreational vehicle , you know , like a winnebago type deal , brown and beige ? uh , why ? well , it s a long story , but i m personally of the opinion that he s moved on from weed and graduated to selling crystal meth , using it as a rolling lab"
"why don t you invent a water powered car , you know ? if you did that , you would be rolling in it"

"hey , when , not if , he gets caught , and he s facing years , what ll he do then ? believe me , there s no honor among thieves"
"and if he doesn t , there may come a time to talk options"
"bandage off , if you would"

"i mean , it s not as if we i m were even close"

"well , i m not actually sure if the cafeteria necessarily qualifies as being part of a hospital"
"well , is anyone else dying to brush their teeth , or is it just me ? what if i ran over to the house and picked up a few things ? marie ? i could swing by your place"

"so what ? we re just supposed to compromise on his care ? well , if you don t follow the insurance company s procedures , they may never pay you back"
"if they can get capone , they can get you"
"yeah , and if you want to stay a criminal and not become , say , a convict , then maybe you should grow up and listen to your lawyer"
if this man had his own source of product on this side of the border he would have the market to himself
"if you had the chance to do anything you wanted , what would you do ? make more green , man , a lot more"

"marie , i know skyler s already told you this , but if there s every anything that you need , anything at all it s good to have you here"
"w what do you mean , like rain man ? well , i don t pretend to understand , you know , all the details , but he was convinced that if you put enough money into it , he d have a , um , uh god , what is it ? a statistical edge ? yes , statistical so right"
"but then he realized that the casinos report your winnings to the irs , and if it gets reported , your family might find out , and if you do not want your family to find out , then you find another place to gamble , like an illegal , backroom game"
"yo , if this is supposed to be all , like , major league and all , we should have equipment maintainer guys"

"i m just saying maybe if we went and got some air , it would help us come up with a plan on how to catch it"
"hey ! if you re not going to help me , stay out of my way ! hey ! yo"
none of this makes any sense if i didn t have enough
ah if had just lived right up to that moment and not one second more that would ve been perfect
"that half a pound that i said we re off by now , i m not accusing you , but if you understand ? and if they ever found out i didn t take shit"
"and that s not psycho to you ? well , then , why should we do anything more than once ? should i just smoke this one cigarette ? maybe we should only have sex once if it s the same thing"
"hey , if you can get your leg up that high , i say go for it"
"how else are you going to get out of here ? don t you have any friends ? i mean jesus , find something better to do"
"honey we got our first bill , and , you know , if you re still insistent i am"

"so if it s okay , i was thinking about using this one for the test"
"now , that is a story an auditor can believe , so what am i missing ? you re missing that you should just take this money that i give you and not look too closely at it , so if , god forbid , i get caught , you maintain plausible deniability"
"no , i think it would be better if the husband were no longer estranged"
"you know , maybe if he were back sleeping in his own bed"

"and after a few minutes i took the gun out of his mouth , and i say , so help me , if you ever touch her again , i will such and such and such and such and blah , blah , blah , blah , blah"
"those men outside are my trusted employees , and when i learned what you intended to do if it wasn t for this man and the respect i have for him , i would be dealing with this in a very different way"

"so if i give up pinkman , well , then you re gonna be asking old saul gives em up pretty easy"
"all right , i look , if i was to tell you , i just i couldn t live with myself"

"and if our reduction is not stereospecific , then how can our product be enantiomerically pure ? i mean , is phenyl , hyrdoxyl , containing , of course , chiral centers at carbons number and on the propane chain ? then reduction to methamphetamine eliminates which chiral center is it again ? because i forgot"
"if you push that way , i ll hold him in"
"get you anything else ? uh , no , i m good"
"what page is that ? the one that says if i can t kill you , you ll shit wish you were dead"
"well , if stealth is what you re aspiring to , you best go with something more compact"
"if you can t get it done with five , then you re into spraying prey , in which case i wouldn t count on another six closing the deal"
"that snub , you ll conceal real nice if you carry it i w b"
"little harder to draw from , but there s really no substitute if you re intent of fooling a vigilant eye"
"yeah , um you sure it s on the correct side ? if you re right handed , it is"
"either way you re going to want to practice your draw a lot because if you re all fingers , well , it might could be him keeping a piece instead of you"
"why ? because if it s just personal protection , aside from a bucket of money , you d save yourself a potential felony two spot for carrying a weapon with a defaced serial number if you d just buy it legally"
"yeah , but if you did have to use it , wouldn t it still be better to use one that couldn t be traced ? this is the west , boss"
"all this to say i m happy to take your money , but if you re not a convicted felon , you might best be advised to bear your arms within the confines of the law"
"i m justasking if maybe you know , when last i counted , marie , there were four bedrooms in this house"
"you know , i mean , if i m keeping you awake and all that"

you might want to learn how to tail better if you re planning on making a habit of it
"you wear it if it makes you feel better , but if push comes to shove , it s not going to help"
"if it happened to victor , it could happen to you"
so if you could just please okay

"if you like , we can give you a list of approved vendors"
"if you get going immediately , your down time shouldn t be any more than four or five weeks"
"if you d like to file an appeal , you can contact i have done nothing wrong"
"it looks big time , but i m no authority , so i wonder if you might take a look"
"what good does that do me ? if you could just take a look , tell me what i got here , i d really appreciate it"
"to me the things that thing that worries me is is getting trampled or or shoved up against a chain link fence because if you really think about it , if you were against a chain link fence and you ve got a a lot i mean a lot of people trying to escape , pushing hard enough forward"
"and if the fence posts are stuck deep really deep with the cement way down inside the ground , then it s definitely happening to you"
it s not as if i don t know how to play
"and why is that again ? really ? if we have the gambling story did you take money , walt ? you remember gretchen and elliot ? because i seem to recall that you d rather sell drugs than take help"
"you know , walt , if you you can always bend my ear , right ? i mean , if you ever need to talk or or just blow off some steam"

"if i recall , at least from the first french connection , popeye doyle never actually caught him"
"what if they are yours ? how can you be so sure ? because i m here , all right ? your brother in law s got such a hardon for me that if the cops would have found my fingerprints shh"
"if they had anything on him , he d be locked up already"
"now what if he puts and he goes after jesse for the murder ? he goes after him how , on his rascal scooter ? ahem"
"uh , but if he goes after him , i ll sue his ass for police brutality , harassment , assault , and other things"
"what else should i not worry about , saul , hmm ? should i not worry that gus plans to murder me at the first chance he gets ? should i not worry that my drug addicted partner doesn t seem to care whether he lives or dies ? you should see his house"
"this is a last resort back pocket kind of thing , but if you really got to protect yourself , uhdisappear"
"now , be clear , this is an end game , if you get my meaning"
"god , there s got to be something else that i could do"
"i m not even kidding because if you really think about it , you can t even see it , so how can you know just how bad radio frequencies and microwaves and cell phones and stuff are getting you ? i mean , you could be strolling through security at the airport on the way to visit your grandma or wake up , bitches ! and then you get waved through a full body x ray scanner , and the next day you could be dead or dying from all the radiation that they say is safe , but there s no way"
especially if you re from a rural area and the ozone layer s already thin yo
"you know , and , you know , if there s a concentrated dose , it s really it s gonna it s gonna play hob with your bone marrow , and it s really gonna mess up because because because , especially , if you have cancer , and you know , because if you got to get a bone marrow transplant , your odds are are"
i wonder if you might take a look
"do you understand ? tell me you understand , saul ! every dollar if you don t hear from me in hours no , no"
i don t care if you have to stuff it in trash bags
"if i get any kind of hit , i ll keep you in the loop on that"
"so if i m out here in a guard type capacity to watch over the money , that means i need , like , a gun , right ? nope"
"look , don t you think it would be good if there was some back and forth communication here ? you got me riding shotgun to every dark anal recess of this state"
be nice if you clued me in a little
"i mean , i m here to do a job , right ? and , i mean , yo , like , if i m the guy , then you should just tell me what the hell s up"
if we don t do this right we ll be fine
"if we re going to do this i mean , we re really going to do this then we have to promise each other no more secrets"
"don t know if you oh , yes , i i was going to say something"
hey ! hey ! this is a two man job ! i can t do it alone ! i m done ! that s it ! finished ! nothing else happens until i get my partner back
"you want to stand there dicking around , or you want to suit up and get to work ? get in gear , yo , if you want to do this because i m meeting up with mike this afternoon"
i would get my car washed there every day if i saw her face out front
"the national child care association gives it really high ratings , so that s quite a relief , and , you know , it s just a walk away if we need it"
"i mean , uh , boy , if you applied that big brain of his to something good , i don t know , who knows what could have helped humanity or something like that , you know ? i mean , how many actual geniuses are there in the world , right ? if he d kind of taken his life in a different direction , who knows ? hank , not to tell you your business , but i m not sure i agree"
"to my eye , all this brilliance looks like nothing more than just simple rote copying probably of someone else s work"
"i mean , if i said something did you know this gale boetticher person ? skyler , i can t even focus"
"god ! if he caught you , at least this would all be over"
"if you are in danger , we go to the police"
but if it s the only real choice we have if it s either that oh or your getting shot when you open your front door i don t want to hear about the police
"who are you talking to right now ? who is it you think you see ? do you know how much i make a year ? i mean , even if i told you , you wouldn t believe it"
"do you know what would happen if i suddenly decided to stop going in to work ? a business big enough that it could be listed on the nasdaq goes belly up , disappears"
"has to make cashiers wipe down cars , even if they don t want to"
"and if not , you can always call your wife , huh ? always sticky"
"just , you know , she asked if i was okay and not to worry"
what do you think ? what ? i i think if you re going to buy me off buy me off
"i mean , what if it oh , god"
"i mean , what if what if it s all just a setup ? what ? what if this robbery that you stopped wasn t even real ? i mean , think about it"
"if you d been there , you d know it wasn t a setup"
"hey , uh , mind if i use your john ? yeah"
"and if you re so invested in protecting this family , it means protecting the story"
call me if there s a problem
"look , if you held my feet to the fire , i could come up with a couple names one or two guys west of the rockies who do this kind of work but guess what"
"if you want out , just say that you want out"
"i don t know when i m gonna see gus again i mean , if ever"
what if they search me ? will they do that ? it s the wrong way around
"if i had seen you come in , there would have been no question of accepting your money"
"if ever you re interested in rewarding part time work , perhaps something after school ? my door is always open"
"can i get you anything else ? a refill , perhaps ? no , thank you"
"if you re gonna be here today , you re gonna have a gun"
like what ? if i had to put it in a word i d guess loyalty
"the thing is , if you just do stuff and nothing happens what s it all mean ? what s the point ? all right , this whole thing is about self acceptance"
if you want to hold his elbow
"if your guy had his meeting at kfc , you wouldn t immediately assume that he s sitting down with colonel sanders"
"anyone else ? sorry , yeah"
"l m sure if you keep digging , you ll find me"
"and brock ? how s he doing ? hey , look , l don t mind dropping checks off every week like ed mcmahon but if you wanna know how they re doing why don t you go see for yourself ? l ll catch you later"
"plus , it shows our crew that l will support them if a customer s being rude"
l wondered if you could give me a lift ? yeah
"but if something were to happen to hank ? that would only draw their attention to you and therefore , to me , as well"
"you didn t lose it , did you ? you would tell me if you lost it , right ? oh , jesus"
"tonight , if possible"
"so , what if this is like math or algebra ? we add a plus douche bag to a minus douche bag and you get , like , zero douche bags"
mike s just gonna tell me to shut my mouth if l get busted
he ll meet with you if he thinks you re a liability
he will waste me if he thinks l m a liability
he d be committing career suicide if he were to mention you to merkert again
"now , we can handle them if that s all we ve got on our plate"
we mexicans like a good hard kick ! soif your partner is the chef then who are you ? don t tell me you are just the taster ! l handle the business operations
"besides that , what else do you have on your menu ? we have several side dishes"
sometimes we prepare a carnitas entra e if we come across fresh beef in the market
"anything else ? come on , be honest"
there is nothing else you offer ? a little taste of something else ? something on the side ? because when l send my men to your restaurant they come back with more than just chicken
l apologize if you are offended by my method of obtaining this meeting
l m sure l can get someone else to take me
"l was wondering , maybe if you could help with this"
lt could look suspicious if the dude who s investigating you suddenly up and dies
white who would be even more apeshit if he had family getting murdered
and if you ever plan on calling the cops on one of my guys again you go ahead and get two barrels
"lt doesn t matter if it s an electronic check or a paper check nothing flashed red , so that s gotta mean it s okay , right ? quicken"
"you re not managing accounts anywhere else , are you ? right now ? no"
"ted , if you don t pay them , they will reopen the investigation and that little fiction l just spun up there is gonna completely unravel"
why ? you re asking me if l can cook mr
"now , if you would answer the question"
"l don t know if you re with your family or whatever , but this is important so l m hoping you could come over"
and what if all the equipment is in mexican instead of english ? you know ? l don t know
"l mean , if l mess this up l m dead , you know ? all of us"
"walt , if you re there , please pick up"
who s the chemist ? is this a joke ? he s asking if you re the chemist
tell this asshole if he wants to learn how to make my product he s gotta do it my way
"and if this is how you run your lab , no wonder"
"now , if you don t want that to happen i suggest you stop whining like a little bitch , and do what i say"
i don t know what else to do
"dad ? come in , if you re coming in"
"if you tell your mother , i just i will never , never hear the end of it"
i wouldn t have come if it wasn t important
"if you would , note the time on that"
it was as if they used up every single cleaning product they could find in a mile radius
like if you were shaking an empty spray paint can
i don t care if he s a pig farmer
if you spill a drop i ll cut off your hand
if you ll excuse me
if i may
lt s really at the point now where he s gonna find someone else to take him there
so l don t know if it s been made presentable yet
"but hopefully you ll understand and if you want to talk more about it , that s fine"
so l would greatly appreciate it if you would just help me out here
"and if they audit my business , find out that walt and l paid for it with close to a million dollars in untaxed gambling winnings we will go to prison , where you will already be"
so if l m understanding you correctly you re saying you can t take the money l gave you but you can take a larger amount
everything else has been filled out for you
"jesse , if you agree to replace me he will kill me"
are you listening to me ? or else you ll do what ? what did you say ? stay away from pinkman or else you ll do what ? kill me ? lf you could kill me l d already be dead
you can t kill me because jesse wouldn t cook for you if you did
no one will be safe at hank s if l m there
"well , you know , hank we wouldn t be arguing about this if you and steve would make him come"
"now , if we even had a shred of proof lsn t that what you get paid to go get ? remember that laundry l told you about ? l d start there"
hey what if l m right ? even if you were right and you ain t
we wondered if we could take a look around
we were just wondering if we could take a look around
what ? why ? twenty agents poking around ? lt d be less trouble if it was just us
okay ? like l said if something final happens to mr
"would you just , please ? l don t know if i m speaking english here what s up ? he s waiting for me"
l don t like my heat so hot if you catch my drift
"because after all , what am l , if not family ? what are you talking about ? when did that happen ? l don t know"
ls it okay if l come out here for a few minutes ? sure
"just stay up here , if you would"
l wonder if you have a an extra cigarette
l ll be out here if you need me
"jesse , if there s something you re not saying , you have to tell me"
what else could l do ? no
got a batch that ll be ruined and an employer who will be very upset if that happens
"l can t be away , if something happens , if he l am very sorry"
where is it ? where ? because if you can t tell me we are dead
we were wondering if we could have a few minutes
"so if i get tired of talking , can i get up and leave ? we d prefer you didn t"
"if you d answer the phone or the door , maybe i wouldn t forget it"
"jesse , if you care at all about that little boy prove it to me"
"you two ? if i ever get anal polyps , i ll know what to name them"
not even if i could
"this panel , if i m reading it correctly , is amp service"

"of course , if you did wanna talk to this guy there s no safer place than the office"
"hey , it sounds like i mean , listen , just call me if you can , all right ? i m heading back over"
maybe it s better if i do this myself
"what s traffic looking like ? if you re moving through that area we re talking about east and westbound paseo , north valley"
"administrators at casa tranquila advise that if you do have loved ones in their care , please do not call in was this you ? what happened ? i won"
"even if i was , like , rich , free is always good"
"how long a drive is that ? about hours , if all you stop for is gas"
see see if it s on tv
"if wendell doesn t eat , nobody eats"
"if you kill him , you re gonna have to kill me"
"mike , if he taped all that shit us cooking , you picking up if gus had a record of that and the police get to it before we do you son of a bitch"
"what else do you need to know ? and why in the hell am i talking to you ? mike , we gotta do something"
"anyway , i d appreciate it if you could spot me my share"
"you coming ? if you have any brains , you ll take that money you saved and you ll skip town"
the only way i know it won t work for sure is if we don t have you
"but if it s not a good time , i could no , no , no , this is fine"
so what ? so what ? so what if they find prints ? and what if they trace it back to the wrecking yard ? they won t
"and , not taking sides , mind you but you did put her in charge of your money which i advised against , if you ll recall all of which is not to be construed as an i told you so"
"you were a tad preoccupied at the time , if you ll recall"
"hey , why aren t you upstairs ? i came to see if you needed any help"
"but if that is not the case , i want to know it , just as you do"
if only i d listened
and he s somebody else completely
"i would like a cup of hot water , filtered , if possible , ad a single slice of lemon"
"you want anything else , mike ? no"
but if you think that d be wise sighs
"if i were you , i d start sending out those resumes"
"and if we pulled your ccp s , everything would be in order ? i m guessing you ve already done that , so you tell me"
"seems like over what else you do for fring ? he must ve needed help running that drug empire of his , no ? drug empire ? first i m hearing about that"
"if i m not under arrest , i d prefer to leave"
"you can tell us what you know , you can tell us who s still out there , and if we like your story , good things can happen"
"if gus can manage it , then so can we"
what if we switched back to a pseudo cook ? absolutely out of the question
"yeah , but what if there s not ? because there isn t"
"if you have anything to say to me , now s the time"
"the lasagna came out very well , if i do say so myself"
i wrapped some up for you if you d like some later
"i mean , what else is there to say ? all due respect , what are we talking about here ? the deal is the deal"
i don t know if anybody noticed but there s a cop shop a quarter of a mile away
"and if you buy them , they re gonna stay bought"
"i will , if it comes to that"
"you like the sound ? it s huge , huh ? yeah , it s real nice , but we re looking for something else today"
all s we re saying is we know you re major league now but if there s ever anything else you need from us any way we can get in on this at all
if you re out with your buddies and they ask if you got a hot tip on a b and e you tell them you got nada
"on the other hand , if they tell you to jump you don t ask what for , you jump"
"and , you know , i figure if they can pull off the magnet , they can handle this"
"you know , sometimes i think you know if it feels right , then if it feels right , it feels right"
"all that you ve done it s a par of you , and i mean , if you choose to spend the rest of your life with this person then you ll have to decide how much you ll share with her"
if she loves you she ll understand
"if it were me , i d tell them all to go to hell"
"i mean , god knows where he d be if we had to go through his health plan"
is everything okay ? breakdown ? what does that mean ? it means i don t know what else to call it
"hey , why don t you join us , if you feel up to it ? we have popcorn"
if you re up to it
anything else ? that s it
"and if you show me just a modicum of respect , maybe i ll teach you"
i don t know i don t know what you have planned and with everything that s been going on lately i d understand if you haven t even given it a thought
"and maybe , if i may be so bold chocolate cake with chocolate icing ? life is good , skyler"
so much so that i m wondering if it s time you made a change
"if you were to put in an application and i recommend that you do , you will get the job"
"what do you say , hank ? you want it ? well , considering my wife would murder me if i said no yeah"
"and i remember i was lying on the floor of the bathroom because the tile felt nice and cool , you know ? and my head was in skyler s lap and i was just asking her if this could all be over"
that s hours if i don t stop
"and , hank , i don t know if you ve picked up on any of the he knows"
i think what would be great is if you two had some space to work through this stuff
what if we took the kids for a while ? took the kids ? absolutely
what else you got ? i could send junior away to school
"now here s the conversation so , honey , i know you ve only got one year left in high school but i would love it if you d drop everything leave all your friends behind , and go to boarding school in arizona"
"if the dea s tracking her barrels , there goes our precursor connection"
she s thinking if she makes it look like her inventory s being watched that we ll leave her alone and take our business elsewhere
"but wait , hey , if the dea s not tracking her stuff that s a good thing , right ? i mean , all we gotta do is tell her to cut the crap and keep the methylamine coming"
"now , if you ll excuse me mike , you can t just look , that s our precursor"
"kid , if we have to ramp down for a while , so be it"
"what if this really was the cops , you know ? and what if you re wrong about her ? i m not wrong"
"but what if you are ? jesse , your misgivings have been duly noted"
"if it s a bad time , i could no"
"but i ll tell you what , being a boss own kind of grind , you know what i m saying ? steve , would you mind if i ve gotta run something by hank , if it s all right"
"no , it s it really is no , it s nice of you and i d like to come by tonight and see them , if that s all right"
"something else on your mind there , walt ? walt , feel free to , you know skyler doesn t love me anymore"
"but here are the rules if you yell for help , try to give the man some kind of coded message or otherwise tip him off i am gonna pull out my pistol and shoot you in the head"
"remember how you like to do that ? if it happens this time , i am going to pull my pistol out and i am going to shoot you in the head"
"if you make schrader suspicious in any way any way at all , tell me what s gonna happen next"
if you ever needed to give the performance of a lifetime it s now
so i was just wondering if maybe your people put it there
"set that barrel aside for me , if you would and i ll look into it and get back to you"
"if it s at least hours , then we head down there use her security code to gain access and we take every barrel we can"
"oh , come on ! you are not seriously still considering killing me ? i saved you ! if it weren t for me , we d all be in jail right now"
and if it s these nine that you re worried about why put the hit on mike ? i had no choice
"? none , if you do it right here"
"if a freight train is stopped in transit anywhere other than the usual yards or depots absolutely , a signal will alarm the fra and the tsa surface division at the department of homeland security"

if the weights don t match the train company s gonna know it got robbed
maybe if we all pushed ? all right
"if you do not abort right now , you are gonna get us all busted"
"if i hadn t done what i did , the mission would ve failed"

i wouldn t have stuck my neck out to get you here if i didn t
"if you do that , then we just might have a fighting chance here , okay ? okay"
"because if the dea catches up with him and he flips , it s good night , john boy"

"if i d known it was you , well francesca"
"what what are you saying ? you doing what you did offing mike s guys ? if he was out there , you would have to look over your shoulder for the rest of your life , and that s not how you do things"
"and if and if he does come back , and he doesn t understand why i had to do what i did well , then , that s on me"
"and what if she s not ? what are you supposed to do ? i mean , what s louis gonna do ? he s he s not worried"
"um so if bowling s off , can i can i get a late curfew ? ah"
"yeah , i mean , no one else got sick , so you probably shouldn t worry about it"
if there s anything i can do feel better
"but even even if somehow you were able to convince anyone i was capable of doing these things , you and i both know i would never see the inside of a jail cell"
"if that s true , if you don t know who i am then maybe your best course would be to tread lightly"
"if he threatened you , or whatever mind games he played"
i don t know if there was abuse
"don t hold anything back , okay ? i mean , i don t even understand if you know the full extent of this , what he s done"
"okay ? you know what ? that son of a bitch looks me in the eye and he says if what i know is true , if he ll be dead before i can prove it"

"feel free to give me a call if you want the details , but , you know , it s cool"
can i get you anything else ? nope
"if you help me out here , tell me all about you and him and your little meth business , maybe i talk to my friends at the apd and make all this go away"
"and i m i m feeling very very good about this , all right ? and what would really help me out is if we all stayed positive"
it s just gonna be worse if they find out that you ve kept this from them
"if that day ever comes , so be it"
and the same goes for you if you stick with him
"if you re watching this tape , i m probably dead murdered by my brother in law , hank schrader"
it s what he will do if i don t back off
"what do we do ? if i were you , i d be more nervous"
i wouldn t have driven it here if it wasn t
"but i figure not much else , otherwise , you know , you d be locked up"
anything else ? i don t think he s told the rest of the dea
"if i could , i d trade places"
"and if you ll hand this to your car wash professional , and have an a day"
"look , if i can t explain this to ramey , i gotta pull my guys"
what else you want ? i m going out for awhile
"this guy is not gonna take you if you show up high , so stop screwing around , or it s both our asses"

"what if it s about , um , killing me , you know ? you know , getting me out in the open , hire some , uh some clock tower guy , or or have me sit on a poison needle , or something , you know ? nothing s gonna happen to you"
"you got another sd card ? what ? what if the kid s right ? what if it s a trap ? the kid ? oh , you mean the junkie murderer that s dribbling all over my guest bathroom floor ? well , then , he s right"
"don t cross your arms , if you can help it"
"if i go to this plaza , i m a dead man"
"if we re down a bit in purity from the heisenberg days , maybe they ll let us slide on that , but not if it s not blue"

"you sure ? if it s too weak or something , i can go put another bag in it"
"uh , about your buyers i could ask my uncle to smooth things over with them , if you want"
"if this guy decides that he wants to lawyer up , i don t care if you are my boss , i m gonna put a stop to this"
goodman s next on the chopping block if he doesn t do what white says
"if we thought you did , you d be in lockup for conspiracy to commit murder instead of here , under our protection"
"but if i were you , i wouldn t take one step out that door"
do you understand ? we ll do him tonight if you want
i don t know if you remember me
"if it s if it s okay , yeah , sure"
"i mean , if that s it he s mad at you , maybe i ll have better luck"

"nothing can change what just happened , but you can walk out of here alive if you just promise us that you ll you ll let this go"
he would never forgive me if things went another way
"if you can find him , we ll kill him"
"christ , i barely even know who you are , and i sure as hell don t know if i can ever trust you again"

"all i m saying is , if you leave this place , you will get caught"
"and , i gotta tell you , if i find out that you ve left the reservation , i won t be coming back"
"if you look around , it s kinda beautiful"

"why , uh , i mean , why , in particular , would we if you wanna give your kids drug money , go do it yourself"
"even if they did , the federal government wouldn t let them"
"if there are taxes or lawyers fees owed , you will take it right from here"
"and if , for any reason , that my children do not get this money , a kind of countdown will begin"
"truce , all right ? skyler , i have news about walt , and you need to hear it immediately , so if you re there , pick up"
they re not sure if they re crank calls or people he s put up to it or if they re actual anonymous tips
"if you re in custody , what stops those people from coming back , those people you worked with ? when when i still had the house , three men came in the middle of the night , wearing masks , threatening holly and flynn and me"
"they told me not to talk about that woman i saw at the car wash , and if you re in custody and they find out they re not coming back"
"all the things that i did , you need to understand if i have to hear one more time that you did this for the family i did it for me"
last thing she said this morning ? sometimes i wonder if you even care about us at all
"gun shot ? what else ? anything ? gun shot ain t enough ? look , i ask and you answer , it s common courtesy , right ? did you get bit ? bit ? bit"
"but i guess if this is the first you re hearing , i know how it must sound they re out there now , in the street ? yeah"

"i d feel better if you were out in that store watching those doors , covering our ass"
"if i get us out , would that make up for it ? no , but it d be a start"
"can we cut through it ? if we had a blowtorch and half a day , sure"
"rick what else ? aside from they hear you ? they see you , smell you and if they catch you , they eat you"
"if bad ideas were an olympic event , this would take the gold"

"if it s supposed to make me feel better , it don t"
"so that s it , huh ? you re just gonna walk off ? just to hell with everybody else ? i m not saying to hell with anybody not yo shane lori least of all"
merle dixon the guy wouldn t give you a glass of water if you were dying of thirst
"my day just gets better and better , don t it ? you see anybody else here stepping up to save your brother s cracker ass ? you wouldn t even begin to understand"
"lori , if they hadn t taken me in , i d have died"
they ll walk into the same trap i did if i don t warn him
that s a problem if we need to get somewhere and wanna get very far
"but if you re gonna go , you re taking bullets"
"no ! shane , stop ! just stop ! stop it ! stop ! you put your hands on your wife , your little girl or anybody else in this camp one more time , i will not stop next time"
i don t care if every walker in the city hears it
be much more blood if he didn t
if that s okay
we could help you check a few blocks around but only if we keep a level head
only if we get those guns first
"and if i don t , then what ? then you re gonna beat my face in like ed peletier , aren t you ? y all seen his face , huh ? what s left of it"
"it s a good idea , okay , if you just hear me out"
"if we go out there in a group , we re slow , drawing attention"
"if i m alone , i can move fast"
"if that happens , i won t go back to daryl"
sorry if i scared your boy and your little girl
"all we want to do is talk to them , see if we can work something out"
"you re gonna give that up for that kid ? if i knew we d get glenn back , i might agree"
"if it had , that blood would be on my hands"
wouldn t piss on them if their heads were on fire
"walkie talkie squawks rick morgan , i don t know if you re out there"
i don t know if you can hear me
"i found others my family , if you can believe it"
there s something else you need to know
"is that what you d want if it were you ? yeah , and i d thank you while you did it"
what if we can get him help ? i heard the c
what if the c
"why ? if there s any government left , any structure at all , they d protect the c"
"shelter , protection okay , rick , you want those things , all right ? i do too , okay ? now if they exist , they re at the army base"
"if that place is operational , it ll be heavily armed"
"i m thinking if you d of stayed here , if you d have looked after your own instead you went off"
"if we hadn t gone off and brought those guns back when we did , i think our losses would have been a lot worse"
"if one of us suggested , based on a hunch , that we head toward that city , you d have no part of it"
"what i want , jim , if if god allows , is to get you some help"
so you re backing him ? what else would i do ? he s my husband
"best for your family ? what s that ? exposing them to all kinds of risks ? as opposed to what ? crossing miles of hostile territory ? if we re looking for a lifeline , i say swim toward the closest ship , not further out to sea"
"if it was your family , you d feel differently"
"if you heard me yesterday , you may be coming here"
"if you are , we ll be gone by the time you arrive"
"if there s anything left , it s got to be there , don t you think ? morgan i hope you were right about that place"
channel if you change your minds
a gas station if we re lucky
"living underground doesn t help , not knowing if it s day or night"
corrosive element is deemed poisonous if inhaled
we have nowhere else to go
"if you don t let us in , you re killing us ! please ! come on , buddy , let s go"
"if there s anything left , it s gotta be there , don t you think ? walkers ! you re killing us ! hey hey"
"if you re gonna wake up , i need you to do it now"
"what s the point ? if we were infected , we d all be running a fever"
"the couches are comfortable , but there are cots in storage if you like"
"the same applies if you shower , go easy on the hot water"
so you left him ? everybody else ran
"if you thought for one second that he was still alive , would you have come ? so i saved your life you and your little boy s"
"and if i could ve traded places with him , i would have"
"if that were true , you d have bolted with the rest or taken the easy way out"
"there s no time to argue and no point , not if you want to get out"
"if you re staying , i stay too"
get in ! if today was not a crooked highway if tonight was not a crooked trail if tomorrow wasn t such a long time then lonesome would mean nothing to you at all yes and only if my own true love was waiting if i could hear her heart softly pounding yes and only if she was lying by me i d lie in my bed once again i can t see my reflection in the water i can t speak the sounds to show no pain i can t hear the echo of my footsteps or remember the sounds of my own name
"if there s anything left , it s gotta be there , don t you think ? where is everybody ? i m all that s left"
"if i do , the others my family , my wife my son"
"so we ve got to stick together , fight for each other , be willing to lay down our lives for each other if it comes to that"
if you can t find a radiator hose here there s a whole bunch of stuff we can find
"if i don t make it back , run back to the highway , back to the others straight the way we came"
"so what do we do ? all of us press on ? no , better if you and glenn get back up to the highway"
but until that time i think it s best if dale keeps them all accounted for
"but if i hadn t done what i did , you d be dead now"
"and if i decided that i had nothing left to live for , who the hell are you to tell me otherwise ? to force my hand like that ? i saved your life"
"if she s in there , yours is the first voice she should hear"
"if we heard them , maybe sophia did too"
t dog ain t you supposed to be fixing that radiator ? what if they come back with sophia and rick wants to move on right away ? i had it fixed yesterday
no one else needs to know that
"if the others know we re mobile , they ll want to mobilize and move on"
"sooner or later , if she s not found , people will start doing math"
"just trying to be the good guy here , lori , even if you don t see it"
i don t know if you re looking at me with what ? sighs sadness ? scorn ? pity ? love ? sighs maybe it s just indifference
"if you think you can do this without him , go right ahead"
"thing is , if we re being honest , he wasn t the asshole"
"god , i sometimes wish he would just have it out with me and blow up , tell me i m being a bitch , if that s what i m being"
if i can get the bullet fragments out and i m countin six
"even if he didn t need your blood to survive , there is no way i d ever let you walk out that door"
"man , i i d break your legs if you tried"
"i mean , you know that , right ? if something happened to him and you weren t here if if he slipped away while you were gone , you would never forgive yourself for that , and neither would lori , man"
"if he reacts the same as before , i ll sever an artery and he ll be dead in minutes"
"but if i do , he won t be able to breathe on his own"
"what else ? the tube that goes with it , extra surgical supplies , drapes , sutures"
"if you had all that , you could save him ? if i had all that , i could try"
"and if i m not mistaken , that redneck went out of his way to save your ass more than once"
what if she comes back and we re not here ? it could happen
"if sophia found her way back and we were gone , that would be awful"
"if the rv is stayin , i am too"
"well , if you re all staying then i m not you , glenn you re going"
see if they have any antibiotics
"because if not , t dog will die , no joke"
if they got into trouble you re in no condition to do anything about it
"if shane said he ll be back , he ll be back"
"that s exactly what you do ! if you need to pray or cry or tell god he s cruel , you go right ahead , but you re not leavin , rick"
"if shane said he ll be back , he ll be back"
"if she s out there , give her something to look at"
if carl needs any
"why do we want carl to live in this world ? to have this life ? so he can see more people torn apart in front of him ? so that he can be hungry and scared for however long he has before he so he can run and run and run and run and then even if he survives he ends up he ends up just another animal who doesn t know anything except survival ? if he if he dies tonight , it ends for him"
you really think it would be better if carl if we just gave up ? tell me why it would be better the other way
"if you hold him down , you could hurt him"
if i take any more out of you your body could shut down
you can go down and sleep if you want to
go ahead if you gotta
let s just talk about something else for a minute
fair ? i don t know if i want to live or if i have to or if it s just a habit
if something happens he can protect her
"you hear what i m saying ? sorry , all i heard was if something happens"
"if you see anything , call out"
"now i need to know right now if you want me to do this , because i think your boy is out of time"
who else ? who d you lose ? you told me i had to make it okay somehow
we d have lost carl if not for him
"and when i looked back if not for otis , i d have never made it out alive"
"if any death ever had meaning , it was his"
"i ll drive up to the interstate , see if sophia wandered back"
what happens if we find her and she s bit ? i think we should all be clear on how we handle that
"did you mean it ? look , if you didn t just say so"
"if we could be real discreet about that , okay ? sure"
"if it s okay , i d rather you never told anybody about that stuff i said"
i don t care if i have to comb the woods like rambo or fetch a pail of water
that s what i always i wouldn t drink that if i were you
"if that thing hasn t contaminated the water yet , blowing its brains out will finish the job"
"if she went that direction , she d be miles from where we looked"
it ll cripple you if you let it
cause odds are somebody else is counting on you
"what else is on the list ? uh why don t you get started ? what about you ? i m gonna look around , see what s worth grabbing"
if you saw how it is out there you wouldn t ask
"if you believe anything , believe that"
"but if you and your people respect my rules , no promises , but i will consider it"
"there s one other item , i ve written it down separately , it s personal , if we could be real discrete"
how long do you think this stuff is gonna last if you keep running your damn mouth off to everybody we meet ? i m sorry
shane and i are gonna go scout up ahead a little bit and see if we can find someone that knows what s going on
"if she made it as far as the farmhouse daryl found , she might have gone further east than we ve been so far"
"if she s up there , i ll spot her"
"ever fire one before ? well , if i m going out , i want one"
"why don t you come train tomorrow ? if you re serious , i m a certified instructor"
"it wasn t that bad , was it ? look , i don t even know if i like you"
"i don t want to , but i ll willing to do it if that s what it takes"
"if we d just moved on , man , we d be halfway to fort benning right now and carl wouldn t have gotten shot"
"if i hadn t , she wouldn t be out here"
"what do you think ? what if it was carl ? would you want us to keep looking ? if it was carl , yes i d want to know one way or another"
"or what ? you re gonna come up here and shut my mouth for me ? well , come on and do it then , if you think you re man enough"
"you know what ? if i were you i d take a pause for the cause , brother"
"if i had known the world was ending , i d have brought better books"
who else is acting weird ? maggie
"any idea what happened to my horse ? yeah , the one who almost killed me ? if it s smart , it left the country"
i could have told you she d throw you if you d bothered to ask
"so i apologize if i appear to be insensitive to the needs of others , but you see i ll do whatever it takes to keep the two of you safe"
if we could be real discrete
"i don t expect you to forgive me , but if there s anything i can do you were trying to protect the group"
"and if you re not gonna let rick take care of you , then someone has to"
"so on top of everything else , he lied"
and if i hear from anyone in this camp that you re not living up to our expectations he won t let you down
"now if you re gonna do this , you listen to shane"
"what if somebody told you something that somebody else should know ? glenn , stop being dramatic"
"well , if you watched the same broadcasts i did , you saw walkers attack , kill"
keep this to yourself if you want to help
if only things were as simple as wanting to shoot
now you shoot that son of a bitch ! shoot him ! hershel expects us to leave ? does anybody else know ? not yet
"i can take it from everyone else , but not from you"
"how can we leave ? it s not what i want either , but if we have to go , i ll do whatever it takes to make sure you and carl are okay"
if you re still willing to make a run into town for me i m your man
"look , if you d seen atlanta , you would not have a barn full of walkers"
"if sophia got this far , she has a real shot , don t you think ? hey ! we got your stuff"
"if you want to blame anybody , blame me"
"i thought the town was safe , but if you hadn t come back but we did"
and i don t know if i want them to
"you think the group would be better off without me , dale ? why don t you tell that to rick or lori ? their boy would be dead if i hadn t put my ass on the line"
you can yell if you want
"you can scream if you have to , but talk to me"
"you really think i d make you have a baby you don t want ? no , so that if i went through with it , it would be on my conscience and not yours"
is there anything else i should know about ? shane and i
anything else i should know about ? shane and i
"you get a good lead , it s in the first let me tell you something else , man"
if she was alive out there and saw you coming all methed out with your buck knife now just let me talk to hershel
"what are you gonna figure out ? ! if we re gonna stay , if we re gonna clear this barn , i have to talk him into it"
"the man is crazy , rick , if hershel thinks those things are alive or no"
"we don t know if we re gonna find her , daryl"
"if we were to stay we could help you with the work , with securing this place"
"so look , if we re not gonna go in there and clear it out then we just got to go"
"if sophia kept in that direction , she might have gotten out of the forest and into the farmland"
"yeah , he joined in , but see , we wouldn t have been in that situation if he hadn t left because he felt that he needed to leave to save a drug dealer"
"but even if it s yours , it s not gonna be yours"
"you re not talking about the walkers , are you ? it doesn t matter if you see them as human beings anymore"
"but if you and your people are going to stay here , that s how you re gonna have to treat them"
"truth is , what else i got to do ? we ll find her"
otis said if you get them halfway out they ll do the rest of the work
"how many times did he do this ? if one wandered onto the property , otis would get them into the barn"
"i don t care if they re sick people or dead people , they re dangerous"
"we ain t been in the swamps much , huh ? imagine if you applied your tracking skills to finding sophia"
"rick , it ain t like it was before ! now if y all want to live , if you want to survive , you got to fight for it ! i m talking about fighting right here , right now"
"move on ? yeah , it s just like it meant so much to everyone finding her , you know ? and then so now you ll just move on ? if we can"
"? you babysit some guns ? man , you pointed one at my chest , right ? but you just you couldn t pull that trigger , could you ? if i was such a danger , if i was such a threat , what did you do to stop me , huh ? that s me"
"if that barn had any more , we could ve been overrun"
"hey ! hey ! all right ! so if your group leaves , you wouldn t stay ? i i hadn t really thought about it"
"he s growing up in a world with he s growing up in a world where he needs a father like you around , alive , not running off , solving everybody else s problems"
if i did everybody thinks that i m a i was just trying to keep everybody safe
"they need us , even if it s just to give them a reason to go on , even if we don t believe it ourselves"
if you sleep
you holed up somewhere else ? not really
"loudly yo , is someone in there ? yo , if someone s in there , we don t want no trouble"
"if something happened , tell us"
"if you can help us not get killed , i d appreciate it"
"if they re in there , they might know where dave and tony are"
"engine starts , revving breathing heavily hey ! we all know this is not gonna end well ! there s nothing in it for any of us ! you guys just just back off , no one else gets hurt ! gun clicks bottles rattle stairs creaking loudly bottle clatters man shit ! shotgun cocks glenn ! glenn ! i i m all right"
see if you can make it to your car
"if you spent half your time minding your daughter s business instead of sticking your nose in everybody else s , she d still be alive ! go ahead"
"if the baby s a girl , can we name her sophia ? hey , dude"
"laughs you you mind if i talk to your mom a sec ? hmm ? how about a little later after she s had some rest ? lori , i had to get you back here"
my dad would die if he heard this
"he would ve bled out , if he lived that long"
"if he finds his people and leads them here , we ll have a war on our hands"
"brother , if i could take it all back , i would"
"if there s one walker , we use our knives"
"if it doesn t kill em , it s gotta slow em down"
are you crazy ? what if dad finds out ? what s he gonna do ? kill me for committing suicide ? stop being such a brat
"want me to tie a noose for her ? if she s serious , she ll figure out a way"
"she needs a loaded gun , right ? you ll understand if i don t send you in there"
is she all right ? she would be if you had stayed with her
"if you wanna kill me , you re gonna have to do better than a wrench"
"if you re gonna be with us , you gotta follow my lead , you gotta trust me"
"if we do this , the people we worded , the world that we knew is dead ! now three episodes left this season"
"if you re gonna be with us , you gotta follow my lead , you gotta trust me"
"kicks hard screams theme music playing so , what you gonna do ? we d all feel better if we knew the plan"
but if shane finds out you think he d just shoot the guy himself ? you know killing the boy had to be his idea
"and if they do , we gonna have a big problem on our hands"
"then why not stand with me , try to save the kid s life , if it really doesn t matter one way or the other ? didn t peg you for a desperate son of a bitch"
"if he didn t figure that out , it s cause he didn t wanna"
so you support this decision ? if you think it s best
"heaven is just another lie , and if you believe it , you re an idiot"
"if you can calm down , so that i can don t tell me to calm down ! no , i i don t i don t need you to patronize me"
"if you ve convinced them to keep this guy alive , then i ain t gonna say a damn word about it , okay ? but i m telling you now , man to man , you re wrong"
"aren t you , doodlebug ? well , let me know if i can do anything"
"well , if people believe we should spare him , i wanna know"
"so the answer is to kill him to prevent a crime that he may never even attempt ? if we do this , we re saying there s no hope"
"if you go through with it , how would you do it ? would he suffer ? we could hang him , right ? just snap his neck"
"you just wanna go around in circles again ? dale this is a young man s life , and it is worth more than a five minute conversation ! is this what it s come to ? we kill someone because we can t decide what else to do with him ? you saved him and now look at us"
"but don t you see ? if we do this , the people that we were the world that we knew is dead"
isn t there anybody else who s gonna stand with me ? he s right
"anybody else ? are y all gonna watch , too ? no , you ll go hide your heads in your tents and try to forget that we re slaughtering a human being"
"previously on amc s the walking dead if you wanna kill me , you re gonna have to do better than a wrench"
isn t there anybody else who s gonna stand with me ? this is a young man s life ! do it
"i ll stock the basement with food and water , enough that we can all survive there a few days if need be"
"if you re staying here permanently , he s got to understand that it s what rick and i say , not whatever he wants"
"hey , shane ? what s up , man ? what you doing , wandering around by yourself ? if , um if i tell you something , will you promise not to tell my parents ? i think it s probably a bad idea for both of us , bud"
"if he found out i took it , he d kill me"
"if i had killed it , dale would still be here"
"look , if you two can t decide , i ll take it"
wouldn t that be easier if you waited for some help ? ain t no use waiting for something that ain t gonna come
who knows if they re still there ? okay
"if i was , you d be dead"
is that possible ? it is if you ve got nothing to lose
"if you re gonna do a thing , you might as well do it right"
"you really believe if you walk back onto that farm alone no me , no randall i want you to hush up"
"and if randall comes back , we re gonna need you here"
you can go if you want
"why can t he listen for once ? ok okay , if he followed his daddy , he went that way"
"if we find him , he s gonna need his mother"
"patricia ? jimmy ? what if they didn t make it ? what if nobody made it ? they made it , okay ? they had to"
"if a walker gets me , so be it"
"so we re just gonna walk away ? not knowing if my wife , your girls are still out there ? how do we live with that ? you ve only got one concern now just one keeping him alive"
we don t even know if she s there
she s somewhere else or she s dead
"even if we do find a place and we think it s safe , we can never be sure"
"does this feel right to you ? what if walkers come through , or another group like randall s ? you know i found randall , right ? he had turned , but he wasn t bit"
"if you re staying , you get one thing straight"
"if we move fast , we might have a shot to tear right through there"
"yeah , but if this group joins with that one , they could spill out this way"
is it cool if we get to the creek before we head out ? won t take long
"what else can we do ? let her give birth on the run ? do you see a way around that ? hey , while the others wash their panties , let s go hunt"
"if we can shut that gate , prevent more from filling the yard , we can pick off these walkers"
"now , if we can dig a canal under the fence , we ll have plenty of fresh water"
"if there was any part of it compromised , he d have found it by now"
"it s not much , but if i don t bring you something , you won t eat at all"
"well , if there s walls , then , what are we gonna do ? we can t rebuild this whole place"
if we stay i ll die here
"you re anemic ? if we re all infected , then so is the baby"
so what if it s stillborn ? what if it s dead inside me right now ? what if it rips me apart ? stop
"why not ? how many women died in childbirth before modern medicine ? if i come back , what if i attack it ? or you ? or rick ? or carl ? if i do , if there is any chance , you put me down immediately"
"you don t hesitate , me , the baby if we re walkers , you don t hesitate and you don t try to save us"
okay ? it might have been better if if what ? i d never made it off the farm
"if a rescue team is what you re waiting for , don t"
"if he dies , you need to be there for that"
"what do you mean infected ? like aids or something ? if i was to kill you , shoot an arrow in your chest , you d come back as one of these things"
"we ll give you new locks , if that s how you want it"
"if these three pussies can do all this , the least we can do is take out another cell block"
"if we see you out here anywhere near our people , if i so much as even catch a whiff of your scent , i will kill you"
if we can get him through this when we get him through this
"if there is , we ll find it"
"but if you make one peep in here , then those freaks ll be lined up outside the door growling , trying to get in"
what if he does wake up ? then what ? he can t even walk
"yeah , i don t know if it s gonna work"
if that s what you think is best
"if you re worried about me and beth , don t"
"if it s time to go , it s okay"
"if you want this cell block , you re gonna open that door"
he d be dead if it weren t for you
"if you hadn t done what you did , then i thought maybe you were coming out here to talk about us"
bet you was wondering if i was real
y all had a gun on y all ? hell i think i d piss my pants if some stranger come walking up with his mitts in his pockets
"but if you wanna leave , as i said , you re free to do so"
"extra ammo , food for the road , some meds , keys to a vehicle if you want one"
my man will be outside the door if you need anything else
"tell me where they are , and i promise , if they re still alive , i ll bring em in"
see what else you can find out
"if they re not eating , why don t they starve"
if i could talk to those women merle s handling it
wake up every morning on the ground wondering if today is the day
"will it be quick and final or slow and , well , without end ? if someone had the good sense to kill my brain or will i come back as one of them ? do you think they remember anything ? the person they once were ? i don t think about it"
"so what you have here , you expect it to hold ? what if a herd comes through ? it ll hold"
so what s your real name ? if it s not asking too much
have you ever trusted anybody ? he d be dead if it weren t for you
"if we send them off packing , we might as well execute them ourselves"
"after all we ve been through ? we fought so hard for all this , what if they decide to take it ? it s just been us for so long"
if we had more ammo we could cut down a whole pack of biters
if only we d gotten there sooner and you were with us
they ll be out of the way but ready to go if we ever need to bail
what else am i going to do ? i can t stand looking up at the bottom of that bunk whoa
"if we leave soon , we ll got a few hours on the road before dusk"
and if the coast isn t safe ? keep moving
"if that armory hadn t been picked clean , we could spare the ammo"
i got you here if you need it
why are you doing this ? i d want the same thing if it was my family out there
"pull it ! what the hell happened ? the gate was open ! where s lori , carl everyone else ? maggie led lori and carl into c block"
and t was bit ! anyone else ? i couldn t tell
you think they did it ? who else ? what s that ? oh you gotta be kidding me ! daryl ! kill it ! back up ! how the hell could this be happening ? whoa whoa whoa ! it has to be the backup generators
"if he s out there , i ll be able to find him"
"what if someone gets hurt during this search , huh ? we almost had in the crowley last time"
"what if it attracts them ? lori , let s lay you down"
"you up for it ? all right , let me see if its dilated"
"if you ask me , i don t think he ll find him"
nothing else mattered
"remember if it gets tough out there , you re always welcome here"
if i please
"so don t so if it feels wrong , don t do it , all right ? if it feels easy don t do it"
i can t tell if this is the arm or the leg
"now , if you would just drop me a hint about tonight"
if i might
"and if i don t do anything , i invite anarchy"
if he hadn t done that it could have been maggie
"now if i was y all , i d find some shelter before nightfall"
"and i know my brother if he s out there , i ll be able to find him"
"but if you keep announcing to the world that you re pissing your pants , i m gonna have to smash your teeth in"
"if it s an escape , i don t think it s the right one"
everyone else does
"if it sounds right , i want to talk them into taking us in"
"if it s safe , we ll get there"
"hello ? you didn t want to tell him how your wife died ? no , i just lost her , but but if that s what it takes it d be good"
"i got something else for you , though"
anyone else ? don t know
"and when he gets here he s gonna do nothing , not if he wants you and bo peep back"
"how long will you be gone ? look , if something happens while we re gone we ll be all right"
"if anything happens , you get everyone locked in the cells , keep them all safe"
please raise your right hand off the bed if you recognize any of the following statements to be true
what did he say ? he asked if i could keep it playing while we wait
we ll need him for leverage if his people come
please raise your right hand off the bed if you recognize any of the following statements to be true
i know what happens if the subject comes for us
"there s no way only so she s lying ? cause if she s lying , that means a pretty sizeable force has moved into our backyard"
"but if she s not , this group with your brother at its core has done something you told me couldn t be done"
where s everybody else ? they were just behind me
"that s sweet of you , but if you re still rattled , he can handle it himself"
any idea where else they could be ? i thought you said there was a curfew
"if anyone comes in here , we re sitting ducks"
yeah ? what if they ain t ? then we ll look somewhere else
"if this goes south , we re cutting her loose"
"hey , if merle s around , i need to see him"
how are we gonna make it out if we get overrun by walkers and this governor catches up to us ? i need you
can t anyone else handle that ? i ve got a hell of a lot of experience and thank you
"what if they came back in for something ? what if they re in trouble ? let s check the tower , see if she s there"
how could anyone else get in ? the tombs are filled with walkers that wandered in from outside
someone else could have done the same thing
you didn t see him ? if anything happens to him i brought you here to save them
"what the hell is he doing here ? hey , hey , hey ! hey , put it down ! whoa , whoa , whoa ! put it down ! he tried to kill me ! if it wasn t for him he helped us get out of there"
let us know if you need anything else
it d be even sweeter if we were all on it
"don t you think ? everyone , if i could if i could have your attention"
she wouldn t have made it if daryl hadn t been here
"even for daryl ? i m hardly the woman i was a year ago , but if ed walked through that door right now breathing and told me to go with him , i d like to think i d tell him to go to hell"
if anything i ll go check on her
you need something else ? okay
"if anything worse than this had happened to you you re like my own son , glenn"
couple of days if she s up
"i thought this place could be something else , you know ? something better"
"so you re abdicating ? you know , i really believed if i kept her alive long enough , milton would find a i just need time to get myself together"
"so you want me to fill in for you ? who else can ? milton ? martinez ? if you choose your friends in the prison , i d understand"
"if walkers just strolled in , then it s gonna be cake for a group of armed men"
"what are we waiting for ? if he s really on his way , we should be out of here by now"
he d take a bullet if i needed him to
"i m sure he s okay , if that s what you re worried about"
"glenn , if the tombs have filled up again , it may just be a matter of time before they push in here"
what if one of them herds is passing through ? or settled ? can t handle that with just the few of us
"if anything happens , we ll just duck"
if you follow me
"daryl ! i got ya ! go ! if you touch my wife , i kill you"
you know i wouldn t have hobbled all the way down here if it wasn t important
"well , if you re so worried about him , you lead"
what if there s another sniper ? a wood pallet won t stop one of those rounds
"and if he takes the high ground around this place , shoot , he could just starve us out if he wanted to"
"hey , dad ? yeah ? if i say something , will you promise not to be mad ? i won t get mad"
and if we include men and women age and up ? you mean boys and girls ? adolescence it s a men and women
what if we solve both problems at once ? deliver merle to the governor
"and if your right hand offends you , cut it off , cast it from you"
"glenn , carl , the baby , whoever else is left"
if he finds out that s a chance we have to take
"okay , do you really want me to do that , or is this some sort of test ? if she asks for help , help her"
"you know , if we re gonna live under the same roof , we should clear the air"
"are you sure ? if he asks , just i ll handle it"
i asked if you were alone
"if you don t sit down and try to work this out , i don t know what s gonna happen"
"would have sent him to kill you , too , if you had come with me"
"they hung a sign up in our town if you live it up , you won t live it down so she left monte rio , son just like a bullet leaves a gun with charcoal eyes and monroe hips she went and took the california trip well , the moon was gold and her hair like wind said don t look back now just come on , jim you got to hold on hold on you got to hold on take my hand , i m standing right here you got to hold on well , he gave her a dime store watch and a ring made from a spoon everyone s looking for someone to blame if you share my bed , you share my name some reunion , huh ? she s in a jam"
"i m glad you re back , really , but if he causes a problem , it s on you"
"previously on amc s the walking dead i don t know if you can hear me , i found my wife and son"
wouldn t have to do it if she didn t get us stuck
"i didn t want to leave her at the prison if i wasn t there , not with merle"
"what ? if you re gonna get a crib , you have to get the box"
"i m getting judith something else first , okay ? i m sorry this happened to you"
"why do you need the guns , rick ? cause if you got something good , that just means that there s someone who wants to take it"
the governor thought it best if he and rick spoke privately
"look , if you and i are gonna be out here pointing guns at each other all day , do me a favor , shut your mouth"
"if all goes south in there , we ll be at each other s throats soon enough"
"if anyone gets pinned down , we need to make sure that they have plenty of ammo"
"if i let that threat persist , i look weak and , well , the whole thing crumbles"
if we choose to destroy everything we ve fought for over the past year we re gonna kill everyone we know
"if you re gonna live here with us , it s gonna be on our terms"
"if michonne can do it , why can t you ? cause it s my brother out there , that s why"
get out of my way ! let me go ! let me go ! if you ll excuse me
"but if you join us , it s settled"
they chose me because there was nobody else around
"if i give you michonne , how do i know you ll keep your word that you ll stop ? you can have everything you want"
"so if we stay and fight , so be it"
what if he doesn t ? what if this is the answer ? why didn t you tell them ? they need to be scared
"glenn , maggie if she hadn t come here , we never would have known they were taken"
if only we had some cab
only if they see me coming
"then if you stay , you can t keep looking the other way"
how am i gonna relax if you keep telling me to relax ? wasn t even close
"if you wouldn t mind helping him out , i d appreciate it"
"what else did you two talk about , huh ? did you tell her about the deal ? did you tell her about michonne ? she knows , doesn t she ? hey"
"where to ? we re not going after that girl , are we ? what if we were ? is that a problem ? she was pretty shook up"
we ll get out of your way if that s what you want
no one else knows
no one else dies
"do you even know why you do the things you do ? the choices you make ? if we give the governor michonne , woodbury stands down"
"if he does , he does"
"do you even possess a pair of balls , little brother ? are they even attached ? i mean , if they are , they belong to you ? you used to call people like that sheep"
"but if i were you , i wouldn t get my hopes up"
"if i pull it off , maybe all is forgiven"
i don t even know if we ll last the week
"why would you kill somebody else for him ? you know , we can go back"
he said he said he would leave us alone if i gave him michonne
but now merle took michonne to fulfill the deal and daryl went to stop him and i don t know if it s too late
"but if i had been like this from the start , she d be alive today"
"well , if you didn t have that baby formula , i wouldn t have"
"well must have been something else , then"
"when you return , if you want us gone , no hard feelings"
"if you can drag if you can drag your right foot back , you you can get them"
"if she s at the prison , it didn t do her any good"
"if he comes back , we ll hold him off"
"if i was to kill you , you come back as one of these things"
"about today , i don t know if we re gonna be able to spare a lot of people for the run"
i don t have anything else to lose
and i wouldn t have made it if it wasn t for him
if he wasn t still here i i couldn t be
"if this thing had come down on you the wrong way yeah , uh , we should probably go now"
"what if you wind up out there alone ? you just give up because you re feeling bad ? no , it s just i don t want to yack on somebody"
there s nothing else to do
"if i lost carl and judith , if i lost this place not then , rick"
"well , if you don t want to , maybe i could"
they re from the internal lung pressure building up like if you shake a soda can and pop the top
you can wait outside if you want
is anyone else showing symptoms that we know of ? we can t just wait and see
"if people die , they become a threat"
"but if you want to live , you have to become strong"
"whatever else this place needs , i m here for it"
you know if patrick was catholic ? he said he was a practicing atheist
"are you gonna tell them ? if i do , maybe after this they ll understand"
"if you tell your dad , he ll tell them"
"so if we were gonna get it , we d have had it by now"
"if it s walkers , if it s people , we can do something"
what if you get sick ? what if i do ? what if we get in trouble out there and don t come back ? let s get this up to the people who need it
"if anybody gets sick , you let me know"
what if they ve already turned when i find them ? you don t fire unless you absolutely need to
where else would i be ? running off
who else isn t sick ? we don t ask rick
"so who else we got ? oh , there you are"
"if you have to go , then i have to come with you"
i was wondering if you could look in on sasha for me
if you can t no
"hershel , if you go in there , you re gonna get sick"
we don t know if we get a tomorrow
"you know that , right ? if it was any different , i d be right out there with you"
"if you weren t in here already , you d be in here"
where else would i be ? running off
"we lost all our food in cell block d , so we re gonna go look for more and whatever else we can find"
"if i don t die , i ll get big"
"and if it s your life or your sister s life , you can t be afraid to kill"
"my sister , everybody else they re probably dead"
"and if we can eat it , we take it"
"aren t you still angry about the governor ? what he did ? if he was here right now , i d cut him in two"
that make them douchebags ? it does if they could have gotten out
"if you come back with us , we can t guarantee your safety"
"i can check the greenhouse , see if it s clear , bring back more fruit"
"and if it s cake , we ll do it"
"if not , we ll just roll"
"if they re strong enough to help us survive this thing , yeah , i think you made the right call"
and if they re not ? let s hope they are
"if you thought it would save judith or carl , would you have done it then or would you have just gone back to your crops and hoped it d all be okay ? you don t have to like what i did , rick"
somebody else s slideshow
"and if they don t make it back , if everybody dies of this thing and it s just the two of us , with judith and carl with my children i won t have you there"
no one else has to know
"if you think i m going anywhere without lizzie and mica if you want them to leave , to go out there with you ? lizzie s sick"
"you start feeling lightheaded , grab somebody else to take over"
"how are we gonna get his body down the stairs , across the cell block and through those doors without anyone noticing ? if that happens if you re gonna help me"
and what if i m gone ? shut up and help me get him on this
"if you need help , i can help you"
"if she saw me , couldn t keep her out"
don t tell anyone else yet
i don t know if i could have
"if you re not ready to lose one , you re gonna lose them all"
"if carl were sick , would you be up there with him ? if i thought i could help"
i can t tell if that s a compliment
but i don t know if i d be here right now if you weren t so damn stupid
"think they re okay ? if things were going bad , we would have heard more shots"
do you not see that red sticker ? i ll be damned if a merit ultra menthol is gonna blow this place up after all the work we ve done to stay alive up here
"do you lose if they die ? no , not necessarily"
"hey , if you do come back with us , there s two things you got to accept"
you sure we re headed in the right direction ? if howard s map is right
must be stuck if it ain t coming out
"oh ! get it off of me ! get it off of me ! get it off of me ! get it off of me ! jeez ! pete ! if it was just you in that pit , i wouldn t have brought you into the camp"
if it weren t for the people you were with the girl you seem different now
i can never tell if he s winking or blinking
"they got guns , but if we roll up on em quick no"
"now , if you join me , i promise you you will never have to worry about whether you were doing the right thing or the wrong thing"
"i don t know if it s the heat or what , but there have been a hell of a lot more of them lately"
"you know , if we re willing to fight for it"
if we re willing to take it from em
"if you understand what it s like to have a daughter , then how can you threaten to kill someone else s ? because they aren t mine"
"if it s safe by the water , then let s just go someplace by the water"
i wouldn t be here if it wasn t for hershel and you
what if everybody doesn t know when things go bad ? how long do we wait ? as long as we can
what else is there to talk about ? you good ? yeah
"you understand me ? stay behind me and if we get separated , you just go run somewhere safe and hide"
what if you re not ? you have to go without us
what if you needed that one later ? see what you can find
"just stop ! hey , asshole ! hey , shitface ! hey watch your mouth ! are you kidding me ? if there s one of them down there , they would have come out"
there something else you want to say to me ? this ll have to do for the night
"i ve never seen a gorilla drive a car before , but if you put it in a museum , i m not gonna call it art"
"i don t know if this place will work out , but i know it won t if we go out there"
i d be fine if you died
what if you re not ! ? beth ! ? where is beth ! ? maggie i m just trying to find the kids to get them on the bus
"if you don t have hope , what s the point of living ? so i unpacked my bag and i found you"
"if we head out now , we can fine"
"if you won t track , i will"
"if this doesn t work , i don t know how i could keep going"
only fire if you have to
we don t know if anybody got out
"if i follow in that direction , i might be able to pick up its tracks"
"if you re trying to make me feel sorry for you , it s not working"
"if you make it that way , and that s what it seems like we re doing"
i have to know if he s in there
shoot ! shoot ! come on ! did you see if any of my people got out ? all i saw was my sister in that field
how do you know if she made it ? i don t know
"you got a damn mouth on you , you know that ? what else you got ?"
"glenn hope you enjoyed the show , assholes ! you got a damn mouth on you , you know that ? what else you got ? do not fire that weapon"
so if you re ever feeling like you need a break i m done taking breaks
does this hallway count as a room ? if you can find something we can use
your dad will wonder where we are if we re late
comfy ? you waking me up to see if i m comfortable ? i want to lie down
"i will get you back if i can , okay ? that s where she d go to find me"
who knows who else she got with her
what the hell else are we gonna do ? go to washington
but what we re doing i don t know how else to say it saving the world is just is just more important
"i mean , even if he does find his wife , so what ? how long do you think they ll live happily ever after if we don t get eugene up to washington ? you think because i m following glenn , that makes me a good person ? i m not"
so beat up on walkers if that makes you feel better
"should we get it ? if he keeps making too much noise , yeah"
"well , if we re gonna be trapped again , we might as well make the best of it"
"so first i say something i ve never done and if you have done it , you drink , and if you haven t , i drink"
if anyone found my dad don t
maybe if i wouldn t have stopped looking
what if you can t ? you have to
"yeah , if there are , i ll handle them"
"if he saw one of these , he would go looking for me looking for him"
and we don t know if there are other signs
"if it sounds too good to be true maybe if glenn saw one of these , maybe he felt the same way"
"what do you want to do , sasha ? keep making these circles from the bus ? or are you talking about us starting to do something else ? we re not splitting up"
if we can talk her into it
"if you re so happy to be alive , then why are we walking into the heart of darkness ? it s not about me being alive"
"bob , what the hell are we doing out here ? why do you think tyreese is dead ? what ? if tyreese were alive , he d go for terminus"
so why do you think he s dead ? or are you just too afraid to find out if he is or not ? hmm
if they come back
"even if they re not coming back , i still want to say thanks"
"if we pick up the pace , we ll catch her"
see if we can set up something to catch the rain
see if we could move from the rooftops to look for food
how long until everyone else is dead and i m on my own ? bad things happened cause i was scared
what else did you hear me say ? that odds are glenn is dead
"and even if i catch up to bob , we can t do it alone"
"what you got there , i ll be donkey licked if that don t fire at least feet per second"
"if there s trouble , i can take judith"
do you think there ll be kids there ? at terminus ? if their parents kept them safe
"maybe there ll be kids there , even if their parents couldn t keep them safe"
"if there s one in there , it s not moving much"
what if i killed you ? ! what if i killed you ? ! lizzie
"if it was white , the fire wouldn t be burning anymore"
and i don t know if i can get that anywhere else
"if you don t want to go to terminus , we could stay"
i asked her if she was the one feeding the walkers at the prison
if that were the case closing your eyes would be just too damn tragic
if that were the case
"see if we can t figure out what s really the problem here , huh ? did you claim it ? hell , yeah"
"look , if she can keep going , we can all keep going"
"if you steal , you keel"
"what happens if you break em ? oh , you catch a beatin"
"if maggie went through , i m going through"
"if you re lost , please just tell me"
"if you want to talk fuel efficiency , we could talk we are not rolling up the windows"
"now how about you apologize for the slander and we call it square ? what the hell is wrong with you ? if glenn and tara were still alive and there were no significant delays and they continued traveling at approximately three miles per hour and i timed it correctly in my head , they might be somewhere around here"
"oh ! son of a bitch ! why the hell are we stopped ? if they made it out of that tunnel , they d be somewhere around here"
"if you know the rules , the rule is never stop ! when you stop guys ! guys ! what ? you ve got to be kidding me"
"even if you got this off me , i can t run"
"and if you help me , they re gonna get both of us"
"if anything tries to come in , we ll hear in plenty of time"
i tried to think what you would do if you were here
i d start slow if i was you
"can i go with you ? well , how else are you gonna learn ? hey , you , too"
"if folks there are taking people in , they have to be strong"
i wonder if the whole thing s legit
if you could just lay them down in front of you
where the hell did you get this watch ? you want answers ? you want anything else ? you get em when you put down the gun
"anything else , he dies and you end up in there anyway"
"who else do you have ? do you know their names ? we just have the boy and the samurai , that s it"
if you even make it that far with all the cold bodies heading over
"scoffs man , if you believe that then it s definitely gonna be you and the kid"
even if that place is burning to the ground
"snarling woman screaming gunfire continues screaming gunshot snarling if they got problems , we got a chance"
"gunfire continues man shouting rick if we run , we can get by them"
"even if i told you all , even if i provided step by step instructions complete with illustrations and a well composed faq and i went red ring , the cure would still die with me"
i don t know if the fire is still burning
you wouldn t be here if they didn t
"if someone was watching us , there would have been something"
"if you found someone inside , well , it would have been surprising"
and we can handle ourselves if things go wrong
things we couldn t hold on to even if we tried
i haven t decided if we re going
"and if you ve let too much go along the way , that s not gonna work"
"splashing walkers snarling snarling continues if a sewer could puke , this is what it d smell like"
"if she s in , i m in"
"and if what you re hiding somehow hurts them in any way , i ll kill you"
now we re out here like everybody else trying to survive
breathing rapidly if it makes you feel any better you taste much better than we thought you would
"if the bear dies , the cub dies anyway"
"but if the bear lives , it can always have another cub"
"if we go in there now , some of us aren t coming back"
"so if y all won t come , good luck to you"
"if you stay just one more day and help , i ll go with you to dc no matter what"
if he stops breathing sasha
"for what ? before the prison , i didn t know if there were any good people left"
i didn t know if anybody was left
"if not , well , you got our destination"
"if we hadn t saved you , you d be one of them right now"
"respirator stops rapid beeping wait , that s it ? if patients don t show any signs of improvement flatlining tone well , dawn calls it"
"and if the bodies are warm or warm enough , they clean up some of the mess"
"if you feel safe enough to be bored , you re lucky"
"and even if i could determine that , i don t have the tools to save him"
"you know what happened with joan ? if she d have stayed , worked for a while , couldn t she have just left ? chuckles i haven t seen it work like that yet"
"if we take , we give back"
if that s what you want
see if it rings any bells
"and if you think you re getting joan back oh , i m gonna get her back"
"if you knew , then why did you i didn t want to"
"a good man s mistakes almost ended everything for us , and i ll be damned if i m gonna let that happen again"
"grunts record nobody s fault but mine if i don t read it , my soul be lost edwards you re healing quickly"
"cause if he had lived , there d be another doctor and dawn wouldn t need you"
"lord , lord ain t nobody s fault but mine nobody s fault but mine if i don t read it , my soul be lost i have a bible in my home i have a bible in my home if i don t read it , my soul be lost mmm i have a bible in my home if i don t read it , my soul be lost nobody s fault but mine"
what if we all live ? the secrets will matter then ? they might
"you hold on , okay ? everyone else , you all right ? glenn yeah"
"check eugene , see if he s hurt"
"i am stressed and depressed to see that ride die , but if you say we re rolling on , i m good"
"well , if i did , then you provided the context for me doing so"
"even if you didn t before , you do"
"so you killed the bus ? if i don t cure the disease , if i don t save the world , i have no value"
"if i don t fix things , there s no way you people would keep me around , share resources , even protect me"
don t tell anyone else what you did
"if there was a ride worth a shit in this town , we d have seen it"
"if you didn t have that mullet , you d probably be like everybody else in the labs"
"if you re lucky , it s walkers or a shot up truck"
"if we floor it we still hit them , they still slow us down , and then they stop us"
"if i could cheat some people into taking me there , well , i just reasoned that i d be doin them a solid , too , considering the perilous state of the city of houston , the state of everything"
"engine starts good lord , take my hand i ve dried up this promised land afraid that the sun won t rise for me crying good lord , hear my cries i ve run out of wasted time dead just floating out to sea snarling go away ! cause i got bad blood go away ! car engine starts tires screech ooh , ooh ooh , ooh ooh , ooh ooh , ooh good lord , find my soul waiting to be whole hold those gates if i don t make it out tonight rattles good lord , give me peace from a lifelong of pain and greed but not yet , i m not done paying for my crimes bad blood i got bad blood you don t want none of what i have don t listen to any word i say i d say anything to make you feel okay i m not who i thought i was not today cause i got bad blood bad blood you don t want none of what i have"
"if they re holding her somewhere , we can get it out of the driver"
"yeah , but if he don t talk , we re back to square one"
"if they re a group , see what they can do"
when we were out by the car what if i didn t show up ? i still don t know
"well , you ain t somewhere else you re right here"
"exhales i don t know if i believe in god anymore or heaven , but if i m going to hell , i m making damn sure i m holding it off as long as i can"
"if they find me who ? them , people at the hospital"
"hammering are you gonna take the cross , too ? if we need it"
"sorry , i m just trying to think of something else , you know ? yeah"
if he doesn t come on
"if they re smart , the rest of them will give up"
if that s what it takes
"if we get a couple of her cops alive out here , we do an even trade"
"if there is a sign of noah , we are going to find him"
"was there anything else ? yes , actually , there was"
what good is this place if it doesn t try to save people ? turn off the machines
"if she pulls through on her own , then fine"
"i know , but if you could , what would you give her ? she was in a car accident"
"did you take it or did she give it to you ? because if she gave it to you , she did not do it out of the kindness of her heart"
i m still wondering if i did
"zip tie zings you let me know if it s too tight , okay ? i thought you were smart , noah"
there s water if you need some and food
"mind if i ask you something ? the way you talk the way you carry yourself were you a cop ? believe it or not , i was , too"
it would work if you had different cops to trade
"but if you let us go , we ll take care of dawn ourselves and then we ll let your friends go and this is over"
"this dawn , she s just trying to keep it together , right ? if we get a couple of her cops alive , we do an even trade"
i don t know if they ll play ball
if this is some bullshit you re spinning and things go south i know
she ll see this trade as a rip off if she thinks you took out one of our guys
what do you think would happen if the others found out ? i protected you
if you want to come with us just step forward now
"for we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed , we have a building from god , a house not made with hands , eternal in the heavens"
"it s a long trip , but if it works out , it s the last long trip we have to make"
and what if it isn t around anymore ? then we keep going
just something else happened after
we should see if there s anything we can use and head back
i remember i just wondered if it even mattered one way or another
i don t know if i thought it would still be here
and that wouldn t have happened if i had just given up if i hadn t chosen to live
"if it were now , i wouldn t make us stop"
"you think gareth would have been able to follow you guys if you d have just put a bullet in my brain ? cut me up like your sister did ? oh , whoa , whoa"
"breathing heavily if i hadn t told them that you were there , maybe gareth wouldn t have gone after you"
"martin if you just did it , if you didn t lie like a bitch , it might have changed things"
what ? you said you wondered if it even mattered if you killed her or not
"it doesn t matter if you had done it or if i had , or that daryl did"
sighs what if there are people there ? huh ? what if it s someplace that we can be safe ? we re miles away
not if you don t want to
"get ready ! sound fades out music playing snarling one , two , three , now ! man , if you believe that , then it s definitely gonna be you and the kid"
"for we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed , we have a building from god , a house not made from hands , eternal in the heavens"
"so if you wore it , you could atone just a little for your sins"
"if you ever want to talk about your father or about beth please , stop"
and i truly do not know if things can get worse
i don t know if i m gonna make it
"after daddy , i don t know if i couldn t"
before this was just the dark part and i don t know if i want to fight it anymore
sizzling crying what else are we gonna do ? not this
"if that s a trap , we already happen to be in it"
what if it isn t ? they put something in it ? rosita eugene
when i was a kid i asked my grandpa once if he ever killed any germans in the war
"he said that was grown up stuff , so so i asked if the germans ever tried to kill him"
"noah , that kid he said he didn t know if he can make it"
"if i were you , i wouldn t go either"
"if you join us , you will be"
"everybody else , we need eyes in every direction"
"if he had wanted to hurt us , he could ve"
i think it s better if it s okay
"if it s not words , if it s not pictures , what would it take to convince you that this is for real ? what if i drove you to the community ? all of you ? we leave now , we ll get there by lunch"
"if we found a group , we wanted to be able to bring them all home"
"rick , if i wanted to ambush you , i d do it here"
"if there s trouble , you got enough firepower ? we got what we got"
if you re not back in which might be just what they want
"if we re all in here , we re a target"
if the five of them aren t back in an hour i ll put a knife in the base of your skull
"so if we see someone , we just shoot them ? it s a good question"
what if they re someone like us ? what if aaron is telling the truth ? what if they re someone who has nothing to do with this ? we re five people walking with guns
"if it s someone like us , we should be afraid of them"
"because if the roamers hear her and come this way , i know i ll be the first to go"
"son of a bitch knew if he didn t toss em back , i d have come for em"
"what do you mean ? why wouldn t we go ? if he were lying or if he wanted to hurt us but he isn t , and he doesn t"
somebody say something if they feel differently
"so if you want to get home , you ll have to tell us how"
that s i don t know how else to say it that s a bad idea
"if it isn t safe , we need to get gone before they know we re there"
get some rest if you can
truth is i m not sure if anything could convince me to go in there
where s glenn ? get off ! run if you want
"glenn ! if you really want to tie me up again , that s fine , but hurry up"
"if this is a trap to get us back where you want us , your people are going to die tonight"
"but if we re staying here for the night , you re sleeping over there"
"aaron if we found a group , we wanted to be able to bring them all home"
i m not sure if anything can convince me to go in there
we don t know if we want to stay
"if we were gonna use them , we would have started already"
you mind if i film this ? what ? do you mind if i film our talk ? go ahead
"starting in the low , s laughs if there is such a thing"
"if i didn t win reelection , i was gonna be a professional poker player"
but it s time to decide if you re the one who s doing the deciding
i could give you a cut if you want
if that s okay with you and it s just me
it s okay if you re not okay with this yet
if this is how you re saying it is then this is what we wanted
would it be okay if carl came over now ? ron really wants to meet him
mikey you don t even have to talk if you don t wanna
"if shit hits , we fire a flare"
"if you re on this crew , you do exactly as i say"
"if we get comfortable here , we let our guard down this place is gonna make us weak"
and if they can t make it then we ll just take this place
"if they can t make it , then we ll just take this place"
"hey , if you happen to bag a boar out there , can i have a leg ? to make a prosciutto"
"what if one of those pricks shuts it ? wait a couple of days , leave it open again"
"sighs sighs i don t know if this is some kind of play , handing authority to strangers"
"if it was just that , she should have given one of these to daryl"
i don t know if it s for us or for them
"if that s the play , that d be smart"
mind if i join ? keep up
"if there s a conflict , you solve it"
it s the only way we ll be able to see if someone s coming at us
"you need anything else , you hit me , girl"
if we can keep that between you and me
"if we keep growing at this rate , we re gonna need even more"
"well , if you want to hang with me , i ll make sure you don t get stuck with mrs"
"mmm , when you re out there , if you happen to be in a store or something , mrs"
"i really think she just wants something to talk about , so if you see one out on your travels , it would go a long way to i thought it was done"
i got nothing else to do
because if you do one morning you ll wake up and you won t be in your bed
"well , it wouldn t hurt if i knew some of what you knew"
not if i don t go
so there s a plan if things go south
"maybe if you showed me how to make them , i could do it myself"
"and if you get caught or you say anything , you re not gonna like what happens to you"
"everything you people have been through , i don t know if you see that"
should give us more than enough warning if more are coming after the bash and pop
"if abraham had followed my orders , she d be dead"
"when they ll put their own lives before yours and everyone else s and they will destroy everything you have here , everything you re working so hard to build"
don t know if any people are shh
"and if i didn t push back , i d be dead , too"
i don t know if they can see it
i don t know if they can yet
"carol if walkers hadn t gotten ed , i wouldn t be standing here right now"
"so what ? so we just let him hit her ? we let him kill her ? no , we exile him if it comes to that"
you really want to wait till someone in that tower has to take care of it ? and that s if we re lucky
"if it s gotten worse , it means he s killed you"
"if you don t fight , you die"
would you do this for someone else ? would you do this for anyone ? no
"if you don t fight , you die"
"well , tonight at the meeting , if it looks like it s going bad , i whistle"
"if we can t get through , we take the three of them and say we ll slit their throats"
"now , if you ll excuse me , i m just gonna sleep some more"
"maggie , if we could talk i want to talk to everyone about what happened and what we need to do about it"
"if it includes sending rick away , it s not gonna work"
"if we see them , we hang back , set up the mike , watch and listen"
i don t know if they can
"but if we come away with a trailer full of cans , i d say that s a good trip"
if you d like to come join us i thank you
"fact is , i m lost , so if you could tell me where we are"
"i don t really have anyone here right now , if you know what i mean"
and if we don t i m still with you
"and if you let too much go along the way , that s not gonna work"
who he is is who you re gonna be if you re lucky
"before we hear from anyone else , i i would like to share something in the spirit of transparency"
"you know ? and i don t even know what that means anymore , but if it means that we ve got to get rid of footsteps women gasp breathing heavily i was scared"
"okay , who else ? we got to take them out or they ll distract the horde"
"listen , if you re still looking to go buck wild with the breath impaired you already asked the question and i already answered it"
"if you were so worried , why the hell did you get into the car with me ? listen , doing something as big as this that s living"
"if i do , how do i know you won t attempt to kill me ? chuckles okay , look , i m not gonna kill you"
she asked if i could relieve her for a few ticks
"and if you come out here , you re gonna die"
"heath wait , what if he can t close it ? i ll be able to"
"we take them on ? if we get into trouble , we go behind the building into the woods and we draw them away"
"this isn t about if it gives , it s when"
"even if we could , the sound of those walkers is drawing more and more every day"
who else ? we need more
they ll follow a path if something s drawing them
deanna now who else ? i ll go
what ? glenn told me i could tell everyone if that s what i wanted to do
what else ? you need to tell me
"you know , if i happened to groans hammer clicks you really think you re gonna take this community from us ? from glenn ? from michonne ? from daryl ? from me ? do you have any idea who you re talking to ? it was just me"
"if it gets sloppy , we fire our weapons , pull them back on track"
even if this is the first time
i know i haven t i just i just thought it might be best if i let things be for a while
"if it s coming from you , he can t hear it"
they ll follow a path if something s drawing em
"i mean , i tell you , if someone would just find me one of those machines , i swear we would all be eating like we were on a tour of tuscany"
"if you ask me , there are too many things trying to do that already , right ? right"
"i mean , it is possible if you miss , like , a hematoma or something"
tell me if you see them coming
"if they had guns , they d be using them"
"if we keep moving , this might work"
"if i go inside , i ll just be another person who s got to be saved"
anybody else down here ? olivia ! no
"just go see if it s over out there and if please go , all of you"
they ll follow a path if something s drawing them
"not if it s going down , we don t"
"if something s in front of you , you kill it"
"so if we don t , that s it , huh ? we don t even know what s waiting for us"
we re moving in the same direction everything else is
"but if i could make it back , i d want to say good bye"
you won t be if we don t stop your bleeding
let s check if these cars work first
see if they can get us back
we ll have to lead them away if we have to
"hey , i was thinking , if we can find a way to distract the herd coming in , then they won t make it back to the community"
"if i take too long , you just go"
"if i get stuck out here , i ll find some way to show you guys i m okay"
"if you get around on redding in the next minutes , you should be good"
"if you don t see smoke , they re still coming your way"
"no , if we go , we go together"
how you should leave us behind if we can t keep up
"glenn is out there risking his life for you and for everyone else and i m still here , so i don t know what the hell you re talking about"
"but if you don t learn , you will die , we will"
have you ever had to kill people because they had already killed your friends and were coming for you next ? have you ever done things that made you feel afraid of yourself afterward ? have you ever been covered in so much blood that you didn t know if it was yours or walkers or your friends ? huh ? then you don t know
the state employed me to determine if certain people who did very bad things would do them again if they were released from prison
you loved them a lot if you re like this
and you obviously need help if we re gonna make this trip
"if they d have caught me , it d have been fine"
"but if i don t i am going to have to kill you , morgan"
"he had this idea that if he lit a fire , it would stop the walkers from coming here"
"he said if he got stuck , he would find a way to send us a signal"
"we ll try to make this place as quiet as a graveyard , see if they move on"
what difference does that make if we ll be dead tomorrow ? we have to ration now i can t
we need to make it last if we re gonna survive
"but that truck outside the walls , it d be inside if it wasn t for me"
"if i didn t , maybe we wouldn t be talking right now"
where no one else matters
"if they all went in and raided the pantry and everyone knew it , saw it , then that would be the end"
"if you maybe climb up i m not helping you , carl"
not if you know what you re doing
"if we don t fight , we die"
liquid sloshing maggie if he s alive aaron if ? he told michonne he would ve found some way to signal us if he got out
"if he s alive or he s hurt or trapped , maybe taken"
"if he s alive , he needs my help"
"and if he s dead , i don t want to be waiting on him"
i told him i d tell you if he did
"i can keep guard , if you want"
"and if i would ve gone if i was with him , maybe i could ve helped him"
i don t know if he s alive
"you know , if it weren t for you , this wall might not be standing right now"
we don t know if he s still out there
"you made a choice to kill for someone else , to have them own you for a roof over your head and three squares , so maybe i m not considering all aspects here"
"this was the right thing ? even if just you guys went back now , if you just told them that it was me no , we ll find a way"
thumping continues growling drawers rattling walker snarls growling bag thuds can t sleep ? what does it look like ? i just wanted to know if it was a choice
"if i have not gotten my psyche situated straight , it s because the shit s continually been hitting the fan without respite"
"but if you have a roof over your head , you have food , you have walls you have choices"
"why ? why haven t i killed anybody ? because if i did , there d be no going back"
"if he sends up a signal , it ll be from out there"
you can tell me if you re not
"see , if i if i wasn t there if they died maybe those wolves wouldn t have been able to come back here"
"walkers snarling wood groaning wood creaking wood cracks glass shatters snarling continues if we can somehow get outside the walls , get back to our cars at the quarry , we could use them to draw them away"
"what about everybody else ? well , let s just keep this to our own for now"
"really ? look , if we had the time to bring the people along , sure"
anything else is just excuses
i will if you make me
"i need to dress a wound , but i don t know if it s infected"
i don t want to waste medicine if i don t have to
"what , sam ? sam ? what happens if you can t live with it ? i told you , it eats you up"
"the people who came , were they the monsters ? did my dad turn into one ? what ? if you kill people , do you turn into one of the monsters ? the only thing that keeps you from becoming a monster is killing"
"screaming tiptoe from your pillow to the shadow of a willow tree and tiptoe through the tulips with me knee deep in flowers we ll stray we ll keep the showers away and if i kiss you in the garden door closes in the moonlight , will you pardon me ? come tiptoe through the tulips with me tiptoe to the window by the window , that is where i ll be come tiptoe through the tulips with me tiptoe through the window by the window , that is where i ll be come tiptoe through the tulips with me tiptoe from your pillow to the meadow by the willow tree and tiptoe through the tulips with me knee deep in flowers we ll stray we ll keep the showers away and if i kiss you in the garden in the moonlight , will you pardon me ? music fades theme music playing rubble clattering walkers snarling everyone , get back ! get into your houses , go ! grunts deanna rick ! you need to get back"
"i ll open the gate , fire them off see if i can get them somewhere somewhere that s not here"
i ll find someplace else to put her
"whether it s waiting , knowing if everyone s safe , dealing with that , or fighting them"
not if we kill
"with life , there s possibility , even if we never let him out"
"even if we never let him out , he could know what he s done"
"if you want me to , i ll no"
i will kill you to kill him because i don t want anyone else to die
"and if you can get your hands on a tanker , you re people our person wants to know"
"if you have to eat shit , best not to nibble"
depends if it was aiden or heath s group who went through it
"if you stop being you , that last bit of them that s still around inside , who you are it s gone"
"but maybe if i wasn t so selfish , i wouldn t have got that iv"
"if it was for us , you would ve i should ve killed you"
"but today i saw what they could do , what we could do , if we work together"
"skin rupturing , gun firing man today , i saw what we could do if we work together"
"i just figured , if you saw it"
"and food , maybe even food before medicine , and gas or batteries or books for the kids or clothes is just if you see it , if it just happens to , you know , be right there"
"either she likes it or she doesn t , but if she likes it , it d be a really nice surprise"
and if it gives you any trouble i won t
"even if they ve been cleaned out , my bet is that the sorghum would be untouched"
"music playing i want to lay it on the line cause everything i do , i wanna do it in double time when i take a ride draws em away from home ! hear me ? action packed well , if your music s gonna move me well , i just gotta feel the beat theme music playing maggie hey"
"if this is the next world , i hope it s good to you guys"
see if he s really alone
"if there s still people out here , and they re still people , we should bring em in"
"if you get lost at night , just find that star"
"if we take a car , i can take you back home in a day , and you can all see for yourselves who we are and what we have to offer"
"but if he s telling the truth , this could be the start of everything"
"why ? no , i just well , given the precarious state of affairs on any given sunday , i am damn near floored that you or anyone else would have the cojones to make a call like that"
"walkers snarling if this is a trick , it won t end well for you"
"gregory nathan , what happened to everybody else ? where s tim and marsha ? they re dead"
"they said they d keep him alive , return him to us , if i deliver a message to you"
"why not just kill them ? most of the people here don t even know how to fight , even if we had ammo"
"if we go get your man back , kill negan , take out his boys , will you hook us up ? we want food , medicine , and one of them cows"
i don t know if craig s worth the trouble
"frankly , i don t know if i want him back in our gene pool"
"and if it keeps going like that , pretty soon you won t have anything left"
"you want anything else ? kidney , maybe ? not that but i do want something"
"negan ? they said they d return him to us , if i delivered a message to you"
"if anybody objects , here s your chance to say your piece"
"i ll discuss it with the people on guard now , too , but who else wants to approach the saviors , talk to them first ? what happened here , we won t let that happen again"
but if people are gonna stay here they do have to accept it
you re something else to me
but we don t know if they have an armory or where it even is
"if we told everyone , they d find out about denise , you know that"
"if we , um , cut the hair trim the beard"
if it s dark
"if you get them back , the deal s still on , right ? right ? if they get themselves back"
"look , if they see you and we don t make it we re gonna make it"
"are you kidding ? go ! ah ! if it wasn t us , it was gonna be you"
"if it were not so , i would ve told you"
"son of a bitch ! where d you get the bike ? just do it ! like you did everyone else , right ? lower your gun , prick"
"if we go kill negan , take out his boys , will you hook us up ? woman what the hell are you doing here ? what am i supposed to do ? you re supposed to be someone else ! gun cocking woman on radio lower your gun"
i ll know if you try anything else
"if you could just shut up , i ll solve this"
"if i m not there , toggle to alpha , listen in"
you re wondering if there s a way out of this
"if he doesn t get medical help , he s gonna lose his arm , maybe his life"
see if she knows anything
"my husband ed , he used to yeah ? i don t care if your old man used to ring your bell"
"static hissing rick would it make a difference if i said i was sorry about that ? what do you think ? static hissing i think we re gonna make the trade , so tell me where"
it s what s gonna happen if you don t work this out
"if we leave , we travel light"
"and if the pricks are here , we pick em off at the door"
"if you could do all this , what were you so afraid of , carol ? i was afraid of this"
none of this would ve happened if i had just killed him
"garage door closing creaking theme music playing snarling so , if you didn t already have plans , i was thinking of making my beef jerky stroganoff"
"actually , can we do something else ? denise after i got out of dc , i just drove"
"it s just this little gift shop in a strip mall , but if it s really an apothecary , they had drugs"
"i ll go alone , if i have to"
looks like a straight shot if we follow the tracks
"guard duty , weapons training , changing up the hairstyle , swigging some swagger with the ladies , spitting game if you don t spit game , you are game"
"if you set em on the counter , i can tell you which"
"and it makes me sick that you guys aren t even trying because you re strong and you re smart and you re both really good people , and if you don t wake up and face your cocking guns d you drop em now ! panting well , hell"
nobody else has to die
"if we survive this threat and it s not over , another one will be back to take its place , to take what we have"
no one else leaves
everyone else stays ready for a fight
maybe they ll let us in if you re with us
"we have to try , even if it s a long shot , even if it s dangerous"
"or she could ve died here , even if she isn t here"
"if they are , they re dead"
"but if it s carol s , then she s been bleeding for a while"
"what if that had happened today ? would you kill her ? if it happened today , i d thank her"
"but if i don t , don t come looking"
"if you were worried about an attack , you wouldn t be leaving"
grunting please ! carl ! carl ! what happens if you don t come back ? how am i supposed to live with that ? what the hell am i supposed to do ? just survive somehow
"if the saviors do show up i don t know , i m thinking , if it s not too late , should we try and make some kind of deal ? tell them to wait for me"
"what if it s the last day on earth for you ? for someone you love ? what if that s true ? maybe you should be extra nice to those people in that rv , cause you never know snaps fingers just like that"
"if you care about people , there are people to protect , there are people that you will kill for"
if you don t want to kill or if you can t then you have to get away from them
"if you care about anyone , m there is a price , morgan , and you re gonna pay it"
"distant walker snarling distant clanging think we could do it ? what ? what they did , glenn and maggie ? just asking if you could do that"
if you re doing something as big as that if that s living
if we have to shove each and every one of them up their own asses
"if you see a car , try to siphon the gas"
"so , even if you re stupid , which you very may well be , you can understand it"
"in fact , you are pegged , more pegged if you don t do what i want"
"and if that s too much , you can make , find , or steal more , and it ll even out sooner or later"
"so , if someone knocks on your door chuckles you let us in"
"you can t do that if you re dead , now , can you ? i m not growing a garden"
if he hollers let him go
"if you look at any of the characters on the show , they re so completely different than when they first showed up"
"and as if that wasn t enough , then you come back as a hungry walker and to end the walker , you have to penetrate the brain"
"but he just says , look , the only hope is let s see if we can get to the cdc , find out anything about what is happening"
"you know , there s a lot of really dangerous diseases that they d studied at the cdc , and so if that facility were to fail , it will self destruct"
the secret that no one else knows
"if you wind up in the middle of one , you re in a great deal of trouble and our group winds up in the middle of one"
"there is a risk that , if shane stays with him , they both die"
"and if they both die , this equipment does not get back to carl"
"so if you die naturally or get hit by a piano , then you too will turn into a zombie"
"rick thinks that , if he chops hershel s leg off quick enough , maybe he s not gonna turn"
whack ! whack ! you can make it from a walker bite if you catch it early enough
it s almost as if the apocalypse never happened
we get a sense that there s something else going on with him as well
we don t know if anyone else survived the prison attack
"if he saw one of these , he would go looking for me looking for him"
tyreese ! how ? how ? carol is not quite sure if he knows that she is the one who killed his beloved
what if i killed you ? what if i killed you ! you have one child who doesn t want to kill anything
"if he can cut himself free , he can escape"
"when are you ever gonna see a person literally eating somebody else s flesh in front of him ? i mean , it s crazy"
"if we hadn t saved you , you d be one of them right now"
"if they don t get there soon , they re not gonna be able to get her out"
"if we get a couple of her cops , we do an even trade"
"per beth s wish , noah gets to go back to virginia , back to his home to see if he can find his family"
"if you join us , you will be safe"
"if you don t fight , you die"
so there s a plan if things go south
no ! can you imagine if your husband just had his throat cut open by a crazy drunk man ? rick do it
"i mean , it is possible if you miss like a hematoma or something ? morgan and rick discover a quarry with about , walkers in it"
"make them someone else s problem , i guess"
what happened to everybody else ? they re dead
you re strong and you re smart ! and you re both really good people ! and if you don t wake up she s killed by dwight using daryl s crossbow
what if it s the last day on earth for you ? we start to get blocked at every turn
"and if you don t listen to us , we ll kill more of you"
"and if they don t like it , they re gonna die"
"and if not , well , we can just turn these people inside out , won t we ? i mean the ones that are left"
if he hollers let him go
"but if you were , you should know there was a reason for all this"
"now level with their noses , so if you have to fire imitates explosion"
"but if she is a friend of morgan , we shall consider her a friend of the realm until proven otherwise"
i would be speechless if i wasn t already speaking
"well , if there s anything you want or need if you enjoy music , we have a guitarist whose talent brings tears to the eye , and we have a small choir"
"and when you re not there to stop me , when nobody else is , i ll go"
i don t give a shit if you think you ve found the secret to life
you mind if i borrow it ? i ve just read every book in this place twice including an air conditioning repair textbook
"is that why you wanted me here because i could do it again if i had to ? no , morgan"
"he says that even if we did , we wouldn t win at least , not without losing people maybe a lot of em"
i mean i don t know if i know enough to know
"and , i mean , you re teaching me aikido , and if aikido means not to kill , then that means that you re it s not about what i think"
"if you need me , holler"
deuces ! ezekiel if i hadn t happened upon you right now what s that saying ? never bullshit a bullshitter
"blend in , get people to trust you , acquire what you need from them , and then you re gone , as if you were never there"
so what if i am ? maybe you don t have to
but i think i can help if you let me
we ll see if i m on to something or if it s just more bullshit
it ll get better if you let it
what ? it s okay if you do it
"but then sherry says that she will marry me if i let dwight live , which , if you think about it , that s a pretty screwed up deal , cause i was gonna marry her sister until she wound up dead , but sherry is super hot"
ain t my problem if he made a dumbass choice
goin out to see if we can find anything for when they come
"well , if it ain t here , then you know where it is , right ? we both know you know where it is"
but what i really want to know is if we re gonna find all the guns back there or if maybe you got a few just waitin for their moment just like my lucille
"maybe if rick thought it through , it would ve been different"
let s see if you ve been taking care of my guns
but what if the saviors find those guns ? what if we run into them when we have those guns on us ? one of us dies
"if we don t find them , they re gonna kill olivia"
but those guns could help protect us from whatever else is out there
"but you can look away now when someone else dies , or you can help solve this"
so what if it was full ? what could you do with it ? don t you get it ? that asshole back there took our guns because he s gonna take all our guns
"so what do we do now ? if they were anywhere , they d be here"
"if you keep it , and they find it , someone dies"
i m not losing anyone else ! now i m giving it to them
yes ? i d like to ask you if daryl can stay
if you don t have something interesting for us somebody s gonna die
did you find anything else out there ? just your dead friends
"i had to accept that , too , so i could keep everyone else alive"
are you ? slamming door what happens if you don t come back ? have to survive somehow
"if anything else happens , i can take care of it"
"that we , um he says it s better if he s close , just in case , till the baby s born"
"if he thinks he has the authority to make that decision , he s mistaken"
"you know , if they see you here , they ll think we colluded"
"if they think we helped attack their outpost , they ll do that to us"
"if they leave , we have plausible deniability"
if we can
even if i think he is i don t know
"if it was just gregory , it d be worse"
"what if i leave ? if maggie can stay , i ll scavenge , for the hilltop"
i ll pay her way if you just keep her safe
we don t even know if she s okay
"you know what they ll do if they find you here ? jesus , get them in the closet"
don t know if you heard what happened
"uh , if you think about it you still saved us , right ? well , that s a nice way to look at it"
anything else you want me to know ? no
so if it all goes right and you do it how do you get away ? it wouldn t matter
what if they came in here before i before you tried to give us up ? they would ve killed you first
but i couldn t imagine anyone else in his place
"if you want to make it up to us can you find where negan lives ? one of the trucks is going back there , soyeah , i can do that"
"no , we don t , not if people don t find out"
"are you gonna tell ? just tell me if you re gonna tell , if you re a snitch"
"we don t even have enough gas to keep looking even if we wanted to , okay ? we said we d be gone for two weeks"
"if it s you or someone else , you choose you"
even if we just have those rusty cans
we agreed to discuss this together as a group if someone ever got in
"the evacuations , the barges if they were even real"
"it seemed like she had a camp , and i wanted to see if i could get any help"
then why were you sneaking around ? i wanted to see if it was safe
"but if you just point me in the right direction , i m gone"
"if we let you go , you have us at a disadvantage"
if you let me go ? yes
we shoot strangers on sight if they come into our camp
"i mean , i don t know if your grandma totally approves , but chuckles"
"and if you want , we can help you find your friend"
"and if he wants to stay , we ll offer him a home , too"
"i get why you re doing it , but if you keep seeing everyone as an enemy , then enemies are all you re gonna find"
"if this works out , there will be plenty of other chances"
and if it doesn t i don t want you there
we wouldn t be doing this if it wasn t for her breaking all the rules
if they know about your friends it s already too late for them
i i if if i screw up and we get caught it ll be fine
no one else needs to die
some of that stuff can be yours if you work hard and play by the rules
"while i m picking up a high level of certainty , i d be remiss if i didn t mention that after a thorough analysis of the grid , x ing out any places we ve already combed , i do believe i ve bull s eye d some worth considering for the specific task at hand"
i need to know if it s true
nothing matters if you re dead
so if you want to leave and go back to mark you can
"here , if you try to skirt it , if you try to cut that corner chuckles then it is the iron for you"
let mark s face be a daily reminder to him and to everyone else that the rules matter
"it doesn t matter if you re stealthy , snipey , gun , or knifey"
"even if you re willing from all we ve seen , it s not a lock you ll be the one"
"and if there s a price , i ll pay it"
"if you re still standing , then it s always on somebody else s back"
"if you knew us , if you knew anything , you would kill us"
if you do anything to him dwight ! daryl needs a time out
and if you d like i think it would be enjoyable to screw your brains out
"i mean , if , you know , you re agreeable to it"
"bang bang plays i ll trade you my heart for your heart , baby give you all my kisses to boot i ll trade you my heart for your heart , baby give you all my kisses to boot if you feel you d like to make a deal cock your pistol and rooty toot toot bang bang bang bang , bang bang bang negan how about this one ? bang bang bangedy bang bang carl oh , i it s just a water heater are you serious , kid ? come on"
if you want to stay back i m going to pretend you didn t just say that
i wouldn t blame you if you didn t
"what if you have help ? if we had help a lot of people then i wouldn t be afraid to tell her , because she d know it wasn t on her to do it"
"but if it s just me , then a it isn t just you"
"and if you care about her , you don t say anything about this"
"i m scared that , if we don t do something now , that we won t only lose more people we ll lose everything"
"but why do you ? there s , uh no need to lie to me if this is our last conversation"
"if abraham was alive , we could fight"
"if glenn was , maggie s kid would have a father"
i don t want anyone else coming around or even knowing where i am
"if you somehow see anyone we know , tell them i m gone"
"if i can do that , after a while maybe months , maybe years maybe then we try something"
"so i got to ask if you wanna take over , why not just kill rick yourself and just take over ? what ? no , no"
but but only if we do this
"so , if you don t remember , i m bertie"
"if they come looking for daryl , we need to be there"
"michonne so , if we re not going back , what are we doing , then ? i think it s time we introduced you to ezekiel"
"whatever you re trying to start here , another protection pact , a trade , none of it matters if we don t start dealing with the real problem the saviors"
"if we strike first , together , we can beat them"
"it if we can find another way , we have to"
they re gonna risk everything if we help them or not
"and if we don t help them , if we turn away , then they can t win"
"and if they do , somehow they will have saved us , and we won t have done a thing"
"my dad always said that if you re asked to be the hero , be a hero"
backing up is not gonna make a difference if this thing goes off
see if daryl ran home like the dumb animal that he is
"if they run we lay on the horn when we start it i ll bring my arm down , and we go"
"if he s here , we really need you all to see him die"
"if you just wait , we llbring something back"
"oh ! and , rick if daryl does turn up here two days from now , two months from now hell , two years from now , just know there s no statute of limitations on this"
you re gonna need it if he turns up with you people
"if i ask you something , will you tell me the truth ? of course"
"if rick is taking on the saviors , that is everything"
w what if they find out while you re gone ? what if they come back here ? do you want to leave ? just turn our backs ? i want us alive
"cause if this doesn t stop , if this starts becoming a real problem , you remember what i said"
"you know , if carol were here , she saw all that if she knew about abraham and glenn she d be leading us right to them , ready to kill them all"
"if we see cars , it s the saviors"
"when the saviors come and find their buddies dead , if they know their elbow from their asshole and can follow an obvious spoor , they re gonna go to the weapons cache and then to the cabin , and they re gonna attack this woman"
"no ! if we don t do anything , a hell of a lot more people are gonna die , people who want to live ! you stay the hell away from carol , you hear me ? vehicles approaching"
"if you and your people want to move against the saviors you need to do it soon , and you need the kingdom"
"she gets hurt , she dies , if she catches a fever , if she s taken out by a walker if she gets hit by lightning anything anything happens to her , i ll kill you"
"and if you kill us , he ll be taking something from them"
"if you join us and we beat them together , you can have much of what s theirs"
i m more nervous about what eric will say if he sees my face like this again
"if we got to stop people from taking from us or we got to take from other people , i don t care"
if they hurt any of our people any more of them that s what i would do
i d tell you if i did
"you were just beaten and thrown in a cell unfairly , if you ask me"
"but , eugene , see , all i really want to know is if you are a smarty pants"
"if knowledge is dropped , i do , indeed , pick it up"
"god damn ! if that ain t the coolest thing i ve ever heard in my life ! not only is that practical , it is just bad ass ! whoa"
"in all likelihood , even if i could , it d probably escape your comprehension"
"honey ? sherry d we always said that if we got separated , i should come back here and wait for you"
but i don t know if you d come with me or if you d take me back there or you d kill me
"she ll suffer , and maybe someone else will get hurt"
"why ? if you could get me her exact weight , i could guarantee a semi precise t"
"i don t see anyone else doing that anytime soon , considering what she did"
"and if he s lying and she s out there , i will find her"
don t know if you recall my handle i don t
"and if i hear one more goddamn word about fat joey , i m gonna smash somebody s teeth in"
"and if i had done it , like i d planned to , negan would be dead right now"
only if they come here
"it s easier to be dead , and if it s my fault you re alive , well , i m just gonna have to live with that"
we kill negan and anyone else we have to to win
"i mean , if it s something that you wanted"
if it s something you wanted
"if we go another day , another one after that , it s fine"
"if we re getting the guns , it doesn t matter if it takes a little longer"
"if i say something , you know rick won t leave there without their guns"
"if if we could even get close enough , they ll start firing , and we ll fire back"
"and if it s me who doesn t make it , you re gonna have to lead the others forward because you re the one who can"
"try them out , if you like"
"if they do , we give them something"
if it is both of us
"if we strike first , together , we can beat them"
"if we can find another way , we have to"
"check your feet , cause if your feet ain t right nothing s right"
"hey ! we were just about to come out to clear the where s morgan ? you okay ? where is morgan ? why did jesus bring daryl and everyone else to the kingdom ? they , um they wanted to see if we could all start working together on things"
is that true ? that they made a deal with them ? is everyone okay ? just tell me if it s true
"i will go with you to alexandria , if you want to make the trip if you want to talk to him"
"right now , if you want to"
"well , can i just if you don t mind , could i walk back to the cottage with you ? no ! we have a drop today , but i can miss it"
i would just really appreciate it if you would justlet me see how you do what you do
"but if you want , it can all grow back"
"take a look if you want , but keep your guns up"
"if you could indulge us your pardon , our path i don t want to hear about it"
and something else happened because we have done nothing to stop them
or else you might as well just kill yourself
"now the saviors have alexandria , and rick and everybody else everything they do is for the saviors now"
"see if daryl ran home , like the dumb animal that he is"
even if it doesn t last
"she has everyone else , and they have her"
you can take anything else you need
"if this one starts , i ll siphon some gas"
"if we have to get closer , there s some weak spots in the perimeter we might still be able to take advantage of , but if we can , i say we stay outside , do it clean"
"if we shoot from a distance and miss , we don t get another chance"
"even if you shoot and graze him , he doesn t die"
if we go in and get caught i won t get caught
"if we re out here , we re alive"
"look , if this is too much for you , you want to bail , now s your chance"
"load them in the truck , and , uh , if you meet me by the garden , i can get you the rest stop"
"but if not , let me repeat your question"
"you know , someone else might not be so cooperative"
right ? if you re having problems of that nature come to see me
i d be a lot less stressed if you d leave my doctor
"this is per negan , who i also am , even if it takes all night to procure them , so i need able bodied persons out there in the surrounding blocks of buildings snoopin and snatchin , stat"
you must be really worried if you re trying to split everyone up
rick are you ready if this goes south ? it won t
"if it does , you don t need to feel bad"
"if it s young enough , i m gonna pull it up and replant it here"
"we can hide like these people , we can keep trying to serve the saviors , and i can watch you get randomly beaten every so often , or else we can fight"
"if they d have just waited one more day well , sasha s a good shot , and rosita knows how to take care of herself"
i wonder if you remember me from last night
"if i give you some water , which is not something i m supposed to do , will you do something for me ? something you re not supposed to do ? will you ? breathing shakily"
and neither will you if you just say yes
"if i want greenery , i eat a salad"
everybody d be a hell of a lot better if if we could present a a united front
it would be a lot easier if we actually were a united front
"you know that ? if you re serious , i ll come by later and we can talk more"
have you ever killed one before ? i wouldn t be here if i hadn t
"you should join us ? if we fight them together , we can beat them"
"i didn t want to break my promise , cyndie , okay ? but the world can belong to good people , to fair people , if we re all just brave enough to try"
"look , tara , if you take our guns , you might as well be killing us all"
"if the situation was reversed , i m sure you wouldn t believe me , either"
"i knew , if i didn t kill him last night , it d be over"
"if he has me , he will hurt them"
he could just be here to see if you were here
"they have sasha , if she s even alive"
"if you can take them out , that s where we start"
check to see if your friend s still alive
"if he s lyin , i m gonna kill him real slow"
"when this is done , i don t give a damn if he s sorry"
"if he s lying , this is already over"
"they will stand down , if they haven t already"
"i mean , if you had a dick , i would still have these feelings"
"if negan finds out they re planning something , they re gonna need help , even with those scavengers on their side"
"have you killed any of them ? because if you have and they ve found out , they may think it was the kingdom , and we lose our advantage"
if i might be so bold this unexpected stoppage has given me the chance for an exhaustive mull
"now , given the loaded circumstances and potential for casualties and resource expenditure , i was wondering if you would give me the opportunity to attempt to slow their jets and cool their roll"
why ? it s more sight lines if we split up
someone else it should be us
"if people die today , it s cause of the choices they made"
we lay our big meaties across the chopping block ahead of someone else s
"both of us know , if we re gonna kick , there sure as hell better be a point to it"
"layin your ass on the line for someone else , tearin it to shreds for em you said it before"
"i gotta tell you , rick , if i had a kid , i d want him to be just like your kid , which makes this so much harder"
"but if it s the others the others who prop him up , stand by his side , even those who just look the other way so be it"
"if we can hold on to that with everything we have , the future is ours"
"if he isn t one of them , i hope he makes it"
i don t know if i can wait for it
but i m also comfortable enough to accept the fact if it wasn t
"rick , i d feel remiss if rick no"
you all can live if you surrender
"if we start tomorrow right now with everything we ve beaten , everything we ve endured , everything we ve risen above , everything we ve become if we start tomorrow right now no matter what comes next we ve won"
y all can live if you surrender right now
"if he tells them we re here , it s over before it started"
"if our comrades had already arrived , they d have been here"
"and if they haven t yet , release shiva from her cage"
you signal if they re already inside
everything else he passed you is checking out
we ll go faster if we split up
we don t even know if morgan s alive
then someone else will
"if i take the two of you with me , then i ve got one hell of an insurance policy"
"if he made it , if they know we re coming , they re gonna be ready"
we only fire if they fire first
"because even if maggie listens to you , rick will listen to me"
"just hole up , keep it elevated , and if you see us , stay out of the line of fire"
"if we follow this plan , if we keep to our training , if the fates continue to shine brightly upon us , allowing us this this dream ? we will lose not one of our ranks"
"we don t kill you , the widow , or the king not if we don t have to"
not for you or anyone else you brought in here
"we re far from somewhere else , i guess"
"cause let s face it , if it wasn t me , if it was you holding the gun , i d be brains out on the floor right now"
what ? you think they were gonna come back ? that they will change ? that they will be something else ? it doesn t change
"let me take a look alvaro if we re gonna be here a while , might as well take care of them"
"rudy asshats , get those guns , and let s screw the hell off now ! man we need some help here ! what you need is to hurry your asses up ! if you re not out of here with those guns by the time i round this corner , i am gonna flay your asses ! it is real now ! we re almost done ! jesus ! suspenseful music plays"
"so , many years later benjamin was the one who told me what i already knew , but couldn t hear if you re asked to be the hero be the hero"
we have to get word to rick ! if they ferry those machine guns to the sanctuary engine revs in distance
let s go see if this asshole s alive
i told you if things started to feel hinky at the hilltop to come see me
"i go to my people , and i i tell them if if you re joining with this this misled crusade , you re no longer citizens of the hilltop"
"if you re still the guy , if , indeed , you have always been the guy , then why the hell didn t you know about the widow leading an army of your people straight up my ass in alexandria ? you know what i think , gregory ? i think you re playing both sides"
"now , is listening to you the right way to go , or is it the right place and time for something else ? no , no"
"if we go in with the right stage picture , a thick and veiny show of force surrounding gregory when he lays down the law , i think things go back to copacetic"
"if they don t , we take a flyer on the place and kill everyone there"
there s no one else ? you re the only one ? me
"negan we can wait it out a little bit , see if my people can figure something out"
one thing that is sure as ass if my people think i m dead a lot of folks are gonna die in there
"now , i realize there s a lot of stress in the air , but just to clarify , are you saying you re someone else , regina ? no"
"even if we get a few of ours out and somehow clear the crowd , they have snipers all around the building"
"if you didn t say it , i would ve"
"we ll wait a little bit longer , see if my people can pull it together"
what if they don t ? there are people in there who aren t fighters
"and if the saviors don t surrender , maybe everyone fights us"
"if people die , it s their fault , not ours"
i will do this if you confess
i am negan ! anyone else want a bullet ? anyone ? whistling in distance
"now , if you ll all excuse me , i am in deep need of a sandwich , a shower , and some of that , uh , wilting lion orchid deep tissue shit that frankie learned in san francisco"
"but even if you try your best and i know you try your best but you don t figure something out i assure you , i will kill you quickly so you don t have to see all the awful , horrific things that are gonna go down here when we run out of food and water"
"but if they open a door , seems like they d have bigger problems"
i woulda still been mad if you d shot me
"i but you gotta you gotta honor your parents , right ? if i was honoring my dad , we wouldn t be talking right now"
"i told you not to follow me ! do you know what happens to kids when they go wandering around in the woods ? they never get seen again , and if they do , they re monsters"
zia check the perimeter ! make sure no one else is here
"and if you can t be the king , then do what you do best and play the part"
"jesus , if we don t we can t let them live"
"i also wish for razzles , but if wishes were horses and all that what , you think this is his fault ? it is"
"would you sit with him ? how s that ? i m gonna head to the marketplace , see if they have any herbs down there , try some eastern medicine on him"
"you could ve changed this place into something else , something better"
something else could
"daryl even if it don t , we don t got the kingdom fighters no more"
"i mean , if the saviors want to put up a fight , we don t got the numbers to make em surrender"
"if things don t get fixed soon , a lot of people are gonna die"
"audio glider activated for sound , utilizing music as decibel redirection , drawing active deceased along with it away from all exits , allowing immediate free passage for permanent redirection , if successful"
scratch the if when when successful
"now , judge me if you choose , but i m seeing for , i m feeling for , i m receiving by that staying safe means staying alive , and i m a okay with doing whatever it takes to lock that down"
can my bullet maker fill my guns back up ? if you give my machines to me or me to my machines that is an affirmative
got something else of urgency for you
if you give a shit carl
"if you care , you do something"
"well , you think we re gonna be out there , picking strawberries with negan ? if that s what it takes"
wondering if they ll talk to us
"just have to get the guns , get everyone else here , and we ll meet you there"
"gary , shoot that beautiful bastard if anyone tries anything"
"what did you say ? if you have to kill someone , if there has to be punishment , then kill me"
"and i if me dying could stop this , if it can make things different for us , for you , for all those other kids it d be worth it"
"there are rules , and he broke them ! and if you do not give him up right now , thismoves into something traumatic"
"rosita even if they did , it was just a mistake"
"if i hadn t gone to the sanctuary to kill negan , maybe sasha would still be alive"
"shut up , al ! if cupcake wants to put on a show , let her put on a show"
"first light , everybody else starts tending crops"
"we must talk in every telephone get eaten off the web we must rip out all the epilogues from the books that we have read and to the face of every criminal strapped firmly to a chair we must stare , we must stare , we must stare we must take all of the medicines too expensive now to sell set fire to the preacher who is promising us hell into the ear of every anarchist that sleeps but doesn t dream we must sing , we must sing , we must sing it ll go like this , all right ? while my mother waters plants my father loads his gun he says death will give us back to god just like the setting sun is returned to the lonesome ocean if he s not back soon , we ll meet him there"
"i wasn t sure if you d make it back before but just in case , you know i wanted to make sure i was able to say goodbye"
"no , if we hit one of them , that could call them all"
"so if we have to take them , we take them"
"if we don t go through em , we gotta go through the courtyard"
"let s go ! is it gonna go bad , ezekiel ? is this going to turn into something else ? ezekiel you are the author of this night , gavin"
it would be my honor if you considered to be the sous to my chef
if she voice breaking
if happens daryl i ll take her
you think i can be someone else ? this is who i am
everybody living helping everybody else live
if you can still be who you were that s how it could be
"if i m not running down rick and company , where do you want me ? sighs"
if you ve got something to say say it
"if we win , do you even want to know ? yes"
you ve taken everything else we could give
they ll kill you if you go back there
"cause you caught yourself a break a big ol break , if you ask me"
"and if and when the time comes for you to have guns , the saviors will provide them for you"
i want to know if you know
"and if not , we ll just send another message"
"even if we wanted a deal now , it doesn t matter"
do not let any more of your shit decisions cost you to lose anyone else you love
"if this infection is attacking your optical nerves , it could permanently damage your eyesight"
"we re on the right path , even if we re on the wrong road"
"but if rick and his merry band of pricks decide to pull some shit , then we re gonna have to pull some right back that we d rather not"
we can make it through this if we don t give up
"if we keep believing i mean , it s just a script"
"maybe it gave them the strength to go on , even if they didn t reach anyone else"
"if they re smart , they ll cover all these passes between here and hilltop"
"negan won t send his people down into this stretch of swamp , not if he doesn t have to"
"but one of them got away so if they find me , negan puts my head on a pike"
this number include the prisoners ? it s worse if you include the prisoners
if i can have the crossbow you can t
"what do you say ? i don t have the resources to oblige you , even if i wanted to"
"but your eyesight well , if there sot some improvement soon , i m afraid you re looking at permanent damage"
"now , if i were them , i d stick closer to burke s pass"
we ll see if it helps
"prisoners will be taken out in pairs , under armed guard , for work , exercise , and , if necessary , medical attention"
what if we could use that to our advantage ? growling
it s all right if they spill out
"well , i m gonna scout ahead , see if anything s coming our way"
i don t know if that makes it right or it does
not if negan s dead
"top guy to top guy , i just want to know if , in your analysis , you believe these people are gonna cower and cave after we deliver what amounts to yet another warning"
"well , if you re not gonna answer , let me extemporaneously express that i have my doubts this little maneuver is going to deliver the desired outcome"
"if you fill the crates with food or phonograph records , i will gladly exchange them for a key to your future ? it lists coordinates for our meeting spot"
"well , if it is a trap , it s kind of obvious"
"what if what if it s someone who actually wants to help ? if someone is trying to help us and we miss out , we miss out"
"if somebody s trying to kill us , we die"
not if we re careful
"man if you see em coming , hit your horn"
"if you re out here , you know you can take care of yourselves , and i like that"
why would you do that ? what else should i do ? rosita
"if , perhaps , people can believe in people again , four crates of goods is worth far less than a sustainable future and perhaps an exercise in trust"
"huh ? i mean , i know you re working through some shit the worst kind of shit , i know but if you aren t the most stubborn know it all prick i ve ever crossed dicks with why didn t you just let me save you , rick ? i m good at it"
if it was my call we d say enough
"otherwise , someone else will"
someone else will kill them
who ? ! negan ! i am negan ! damn right you are ! we all are ! don t matter if the big man ain t here
we don t know if he s gone gone
"henry , if you go out there during the attack , you ll die"
"but if you don t , i have bullets that i will personally fire into all"
"you sure you wanna face that with him if he shows ? better to beg forgiveness than ask permission , d"
"well , if anybody s home it s time to do some proper slaughtering"
what if it wasn t ? then it d be my own damn fault
"if he were here , if i stuck with him when he left , we d be with the saviors , too , or some other group just like em"
even if it came at a cost
i don t know if that makes me a good leader
"well if i d known getting stabbed would get your attention , i would ve done it a lot sooner"
henry i wouldn t have died if i went out there
"if gregory was in charge , this this place wouldn t be here anymore"
and why would you be in here if you re not with them ? i m not dumb
"one of you knows who killed ben , and if i have to , i m gonna start shooting people until someone tells me"
"henry ! henry , if you re down here , come on out ! yo"
"daryl look , if dwight knew , could ve warned us , could ve sent us a message"
everybody else in the battle who got injured got sick
"look , you said that we might need him , and we might need him now more than ever , and what i m saying is that if i had killed him , maybe i would be dead right now"
"if the saviors are coming back , we ll have , maybe minutes heads up"
"you think the saviors have what he d need to make them ? if they don t , i know where they d find it"
"what if it was you ? how d you get back there ? you re on foot , there s probably someone injured"
"i don t know if this is any kind of a lead , but if you re going out there it s not for nothing can you do me a favor ? if you happen to find them don t kill any more of them than you have to"
"cause if you did , you wouldn t have left me sitting here with a bag full of guns"
"found something else in there , too"
"but that doesn t mean it will , and and it doesn t mean that i couldn t find myself again if it does"
"if shit could shit , it still wouldn t look as shitty as you"
don t matter if the big man ain t here
"so if they won t end it , you have to"
"even if we re double timing it around the clock with nary a carey for workplace safety , it isn t gonna prevent us from meeting our quixotic quota by the proverbial crap ton"
"if it was of the blood variety , you would ve already been dead"
"if you cannot accept that we re your people now , you may as well cut to the chase and chew the next bullet coming off that line"
"see , i want to know if you remember who you are"
"everyone else here is gonna do the same thing , same time , different spot"
"we can t let him get back to them ! if you see him , blow that pig s head off ! grunting"
"if you re here right now , you re in"
the kill is yours if you want it
"if you can do that then , hell you should be the man"
"planning on killing me like , what else am i gonna do besides crush the guy s throat ? yeah"
"that is , if you accept the promotion"
"see , i knew that i could count on you to deliver my plan to rick , my brilliant , if i do say so myself , fake ass plan"
"if negan needs bullets to end this war , then , by ginger , he s gonna get em"
i just wonder if this is what you wanted
"and if you do , there ll just be someone else to fight"
i wouldn t accept your surrender if you came to me on your knees
"how you doin , boss ? if this morning is to be our last , it will be a fine morning , indeed"
"yeah , if they re planning anything , we ll see it"
i asked maggie if we could clear the walkers from the wall
"it s everybody else , and i m gonna keep em alive"
what what does it matter if we spend whatever s left on keeping people alive ? because we haven t lost everything
map will show you where i ll be if there s trouble
"the thing is , it came from a less than reliable source , so if i were him , i d be scouting ahead"
"listen you don t think you can kill your way out of this , seeing everybody else go , do you ? huh ? cause let me tell you not gonna happen"
"so that s it ? your confession is that you re gonna kill every last one of them ? when you spoke before , you seemed almost as if you didn t want it to happen"
guess what else i did
even if she s not with us
gonna try and make something else out of it
"if i ever see your face around here again , i ll kill you"
if you wanna
"let s take the lot , get back , see if the others need help"
i can t tell if he likes me
"if it makes you feel any better , i was pretty sure he hated me , too"
keep an eye on the trade road in case anyone else tries to move through
"oh , no , i didn t if you ll let me , i d like to help arrange a funeral"
"if alexandria sends another person out , i could use the help back home"
"i ll , uh i i ll sit with you , if you d like"
"if anybody deserves to be happy , it s you"
"i ll tell you something else , gregory"
"maggie will do whatever her pal rick says , even if it s not good for hilltop"
i m angry to see the lives at the hilltop your son s life being treated like the price of doing someone else s business
"if he s worried , there s a reason"
i m sure you have one if you want it
this place ? i built this place ! none of this would exist if it wasn t for me
if i pushed too hard no
"i d love for you to visit alexandria sometime , if you re up for it"
"just talk to me about anything else , please"
"this place is doing better than anywhere else , and you ve been generous"
"i m asking if you ll be generous again , if you ll stretch"
"if my people want to work on the bridge , i won t stop them"
"what do you want ? if the sanctuary needs food , i ll give it to em"
"if the sanctuary needs food , i ll give it to em"
"if the kingdom didn t need me and henry didn t have school , i d stay here to drive in the last nail myself"
"how fast can we have those supports ready ? well , ditto on the six to nine , but if we boost our juice and shed the lead , i think we can beat it"
"if we wait , we ll wind up drawing that other herd"
"if the herd comes , we ll redirect"
"but if keeping him locked up means that the crops don t get planted , then it s not just him that gets punished"
you re welcome to stay the night here if you d like
"so , if not today , when ? i deserve a damn answer"
"i got no place else to be , okay ? chair creaks"
i don t know if she hanged gregory for everyone or for herself or both
"and i trust her her instincts , if not her every decision"
"there are more of them here than from anywhere else , and they re scared"
"if they wind up deciding they re safer back home , this whole thing s a wash"
"if the herd isn t pulled soon , they re gonna run right into our crew"
"i if you don t mind me asking , what changed ? you know , my daddy drank"
"and if he hadn t have been given a second chance , a lot of people would have been worse off for it"
"and every saturday night , i d pick up some dipshit like you and have to listen to him run his mouth in the back of my car , every one of them tryin to blame someone else for their own damn problems"
"if i see your face again , stitches won t fix what i do to you"
wouldn t stay if you begged me
if we can keep the wound from getting infected
"can i ask you a personal question ? if i said no , would it stop you ? who s that woman you had me draw ? come on"
"my vows don t prohibit me from well if that s not stopping you , then what is ? you still afraid ? if that is the case , i m gonna be very disappointed"
even if everyone isn t all in yet
"jed guess they re gonna execute every last one of us ! just like justin ! regina not if we have guns , too"
"even if she doesn t have anything to do with it , some of them think she does"
"if we can , then i ll think about it"
rick asked if i was with you all night
"i wondered if it could be from a knife , but it s small , round , and clean"
"if i d have killed him , i d have killed him in plain sight"
"why do they get this future ? and glenn don t ? or abraham ? or sasha ? all the people the kingdom lost hilltop oceanside ? you ever think about what they want ? what they d do , if they could ? yeah , i do"
"if we don t figure out what happened , sanctuary is gone"
"if that happens , we won t finish the work before the water rises"
"cause if we don t find arat , we re gonna have a fight whether we want it or not"
"it s far from here , but if we go together , we can get there"
but if you can trust me and help me with one small part of the deal we can have a life like you can t imagine
but if you don t give up that gun her life ain t gonna count for shit for too much longer
"maybe if i d just , well , read more books engineering , motivational , or otherwise maybe we would ve maybe we could ve don t do that"
what if they can t ? what if it what if it goes down the same way it did here ? then what ? then that s on them
i don t know if we re doing the right thing here
"but if anyone gives me hope for how things can turn out , it s you"
did he say anything else ? just that you d know what that means
"ar one , i need you to get an urgent message to alexandria if maggie rhee shows up , delay her at the gate and alert michonne right away"
"and , maggie , if you re listening let s talk"
what else ? negan
"i mean , i i m proof that you re making a civilization , right ? i mean , that s what your boyfriend says , so hard to be that if i m dead from starvation"
i m not if you stay and talk to me
"man , your ass wouldn t even be alive if it wasn t for glenn"
"if this doesn t work , if she kills negan , he becomes a martyr"
"if we hurry , we can make it to the kingdom by nightfall"
"anne ! if you want to go fast , go alone"
"if you want to go far , go together"
"if this is a trick , there can still be consequences"
"if i need evacuation , you know that i m desperate"
"you re willing to turn this into something else ? for him ? not for him , for me"
"if he d butchered rick in front of you instead of glenn mm , maggie"
"if you had a child to raise alone because of him , he would ve been dead a long time ago , and you know it"
"if there is something else that i can do , michonne"
"maybe if i tried harder , done things different , listened more my girl , she s strong , and my grandson , he ll only make her stronger"
can you help him ? i warned you there d be consequences if you tried something
"if they don t go , i don t go"
"if i haven t after all these years , it s probably not gonna happen"
"and after the fair , you ll need him for something else and then something else after that"
i d still feel better if jerry or i came with you
"if we could bring the communities back together as full partners , it would it would change everything"
"before all this , if you saw us all sittin at the same table at , like , a restaurant , a bar , or something breathes deeply"
"if that s everything , i d like to motion for a vote"
"what is it ? you wanna tell him ? michonne , if you have something to say , s it s a prison tattoo"
he thinks that if we went further out mm hmm
"but think what we might find , who we might find , what else might be out there"
"but if you wanna keep saying it , i won t stop you"
but i watched what you did to protect him how nothing else mattered except him and i need to be that now for them
"cause what do i need with a stick ? everything else is ours , and that ll make us square"
"if airplane a is flying east at miles per hour and airplane b is flying west at miles per hour , how you know what ? i would definitely recommend booking a seat on airplane c , because that is shaping up to be one hell of a mid air collision"
why just math ? because it doesn t matter if you re a good or bad person on the inside
"that worked out great for bernie , right ? if bernie could see this place , see what life we could live , you know he wanted us to have it , right ? we don t have a choice"
"if i had all this , i wouldn t trust me , either"
or else we wouldn t be here
"if i knew we were gonna be booted as soon as i recovered , i would ve hit my head a bit harder"
if their story checks out
you d feel better if you just say it
"we ve got problems of our own at the kingdom , and i d just feel really a lot better if you were there with him"
your men ? what about you ? i came to see if your story checks out
"magna so we re just supposed to trust her if she doesn t even trust us ? i mean , guys , we we made it this long"
"tara can t cover for you ? if she knew i ve been coming this far out without a security detail as it is , she wants to have me tried for dereliction of duty"
if michonne knew i was violating protocol like this ? sighs
"the dog checks the traps , lets me know if i have a walker problem"
"and if we re trying to rebuild something , you can t ignore that"
"michonne i ll probably reach alexandria before you get back to hilltop , so if you need any supplies , you should take them"
i don t know what she ll do if she sees me
why ? wonder if she ll recognize me
"if it were me , i d have you up on that wall ready to shoot an arrow at anyone i didn t like the looks of"
"if she s been out the entire time , how do you know eugene was with her ? aaron told us"
"and if you want to stay , stay , i m gonna have to talk to him"
"if we plan on staying awhile , we should be thinking about how to prove our worth"
"michonne so , what else don t i know ? i didn t know anything about eugene and rosita but you knew aaron was working a backchannel hilltop is not a backchannel , michonne"
if alexandria could just send a delegation i m sorry
sounds like somebody else i know
i think you d be a damn good leader if you d just stop fighting it
mind if i hitch a ride ? back to kingdom ? i talked to tara
i wouldn t be leaving if i didn t trust him
"oh , i was gonna see if enid wanted to um"
"i keep trying to figure out what s underneath it all , cause i think , if i dig deep enough , i ll find a person"
"well , if it s dislocated , we can just pop it back in no"
"i wanna love you , baby if this is your idea of fun , i d hate to see what happens when you get bored"
"hey , asshole ! what d you do that for ? ! if i had to explain it , you wouldn t understand"
"and if it s alive , it can change"
"if they can learn to talk , maybe they can learn strategy and how to hunt"
"if anyone stays , it s gonna be me"
"i offered to take you on and teach you , but if this is how you treat your commitments , you can take your scrawny ass back to kingdom"
"so you just pull that trigger if that s what you re gonna do , little lady"
"even if they try to hurt me , i promise you , i won t hurt them"
"but if i see you again , i ll shoot"
if i hadn t jesus made his own decisions
"if we get caught on the wrong side of it , we re gonna be out here till morning"
"what the hell were you doing ? we we were just trying to see if they were good people , too"
if she doesn t you know what you have to do
"i m torn to tethers about jesus , but if anything had happened to you eugene i keep thinking that that in a quick twist , it could ve been me instead of him at the end of that blade"
"if you have found shelter outside the city , stay where you are and await further instruction"
and what if we don t ? we will
"henry you want my other egg ? i could roll it to you , if if you want"
"you think i m messed up ? how is hunger a gift ? if i have to explain it , you wouldn understand"
"well , i m sorry if i don t want to orphan my kid"
get in there ! what the hell s wrong with you ? huh ? telling her about the kingdom ? what if there s more of her people out there ? you got family at the kingdom
what would your mom do if she crossed some of our people ? would she kill them ? she would if she had to
"ohh ! i don t give a shit what you do with your life , but i ll be damned if i m gonna let you risk ours ! grunts"
they ll help you if you help them
"but if we go against tara , we could lose everything"
who else ? it s luke
even if it costs us all this
"so let me ask you , if your dad s dead , who gave em to you ? my mom"
"what s up ? if we hadn t left our post , we d be dead like the others"
"if we had a vote , we had a choice"
"if someone dies or gets taken or whatever , they move on"
does that not matter ? what about our missing people ? if my mom found them i can t think of a reason she d keep them alive
you go if you want
i don t know if i m doing the right thing here
"tara yeah , but what if she has alden and luke ? pissing her off can get them killed"
"we re not heading back together ? what s going on ? where s everybody else going , and why are you scared to tell me ? scared ? what ? laughs"
"now if it s a fight you re lookin for , we got enough firepower to light you up"
"and if they love it , if if this moment of fellowship with their neighbors is seared into their hearts and minds , then they ll fight to preserve those bonds"
"if that s not worth fighting for , i don t know what the hell is"
"you good to assist , d ? if you re good with them"
if the mother can t quiet the child then the dead will
i just don t want you getting your hopes up if it doesn t happen
"then , i can t wait to see the look on your face if it does"
what if the fair isn t enough ? what if more trade and more training isn t enough ? we should talk to jesus about the possibility of taking us in if things get worse
"henry , henry if there was something i could do to help her , i would"
she ll kill them if we don t give her back
"and then , someone else close to me died"
if that s what you think s best
if alexandria could just send a delegation i m sorry
what else ? that s it
who else knew about this ? just eugene and rosita
"we would ve told you if we d found someone out there , but we didn t"
then who knows who else was listening ? we weren t being careless with it
negan got out while you were distracted because of it ! i can t do my job if the council is keeping things from me
carol wouldn t ask for help a second time if it wasn t serious
but what does it mean for alexandria to survive if it means that the kingdom falls ? it means alexandria survives
"what d she say ? if it s all right with you , i d rather not talk about it"
"but if it s too much and you want to walk , i get it"
"i ve also brought along my scoring rubric and evaluative criteria , if that would be helpful"
"but if you ll pardon my french , you being a man of the cloth and all you d be a damn fool to let her go"
because you knew you d be a dead man if you tried
"what do you want ? if you re not gonna kill me , then maybe you could learn to trust me a little bit"
"if spouting fresh bullshit counts as change , congratulations , negan , you are a new man"
"if this is why you came back , you should ve stayed out there"
"we know , if there s conflict , we ll win"
"if you have a problem with me as leader , you know what to do"
"so if he s not your friend , then why are you talking to him ? he listens to me"
"and if we ever let him out , it would start all over again"
and when her breathing steadied i asked her if she was okay
"if she feels something , someone like him , from somewhere like that you need to know"
if the council wants to revote to send a delegation to the fair i won t veto it
"what about the ones with the skins ? if our people cross with them , they they ll be risking their lives"
they can t blame hilltop if we just disappear
we couldn t pay these pirates if we wanted to
"if jed s group was out there , something must have happened to them for these highwaymen to move in on their territory"
"they travel in a herd , but there s only like five or six of them in the middle , right ? yeah , but if we go up there , we re trapped"
what if you re wrong ? it has risks
we ll talk to them and if i m wrong and they don t listen then we ll kill them
"if we take her back , my friends die your friends , too"
"well , how about this for an alternative solution ? if the kingdom won t pay to use our roads maybe they ll pay for you"
what good are all the things you steal if you can t trade for the things you need ? you re gonna have to do better than that
"i mean , i just wasn t gonna let them take you if you didn t want to go"
"how you gonna help if you ain t gonna fight ? no , you ll just get in the way"
"if that happens , you run"
"if her people find out we re there , everybody hell , we ain t staying"
if those skin jobs are looking they ll find us soon enough
"well , if we want in , looks like we got to go aro crafty maneuver"
"if i d known all this , i wouldn t have"
might be easier if the only life i had to risk was my own
if i could just walk away and take all the risk with me if that somehow could make everyone else safe that wouldn t be so hard
would you stay if my mom says it s okay ? nah
what if i never find him ? you might not
"but if you give up now , then you definitely never will"
"i had a snack before , so is it okay if i go to my room ? sure"
"and now , maybe if you did that , you d be talking to her right now instead of me"
you remember that ? what else ? jocelyn
but it s okay if it does
"if you go , too , everybody s gonna want to know why"
"if her mother retaliates , it s gonna be against hilltop , not alexandria"
"i left some of my best fighters at hilltop , but if daryl s right about these skin job numbers , scoffs"
"rachel so we head out in the morning ? no , they can take advantage if we wait"
"if hilltop s in danger , it s cause of me"
i m sure he d let you read it if you want
"look , i was gonna go tomorrow , but i can take your place if you want to rest"
"so if you re gonna be living with us , i hope you don t plan on causing any problems"
dianne too many people would notice if we all go at once
we d be honored if you d consider calling the kingdom your home
"if anyone else was out here , my patrols would ve seen em"
something else they put up a fight
"but if those skin freaks followed them from hilltop , the whole community is in danger right now"
i don t know if there s a happy ending here
no one else had to die
"figure if i can get it up and running , that repeater we set up might allow us all to talk to each other"
"couple of fine gentlemen , including myself , are hosting an inter community rpg campaign later if you re interested don t push it"
"i don t know if addy likes me like that , but i don t like her"
"if rodney and gage were telling the truth , i d feel bad about shoving goat shit in their faces"
can you believe michonne came ? i wouldn t have believed it if i hadn t seen her myself
"i think we clean up pretty well , if i do say so myself"
"but if he doesn t , he s gonna be one sorry dude"
"and if the alpha doesn t assert herself , then there s chaos"
"if you happen to see her , could you tell her i need to speak with her ? ezekiel , i got to talk to you"
if only for now
when no one else did
we ll have to travel through the night if we have any hope of making it to the next way station before it hits
"i m hoping for a fresh start with her at hilltop , and it d be easier if it was just us"
"even if we hauled ass overnight , we d never make it"
"does anybody else smell something ? can you stop being such an asshole ? no , he s right"
"maybe if i head to the way station , bring back supplies"
that s cold comfort if we trigger a war
what if they already know ? they could ve been watching us in that field back there
my people wouldn t be here like this if it wasn t for me
"if they see us crossing that border , it could start something"
"if they hadn t taken me in to begin with , all those people would still be alive"
no one else has to know
"hey , if we call it kingtop , maybe we could make that a thing"
we don t even know if they were there
"but if there s a mask , maybe there are other signs of them out there"
"we re the villains of someone else s story , a threat to their survival , so dangerous they threaten to wipe us out"
"if there s a mask , there s a reason"
"i lost rick on a if it was them , you could ve died"
"so if i were to heat the milk up for , like , minutes and seconds i have rigged the kitchen timer to go off at precisely and so such a scenario will not come to pass"
"listen , if you ve got something to say , can you just please get to the point ? because i don t have time today"
"now , you ask me , you gotta make em feel secure , even if it s just for show"
"but , hell , at the end of the day , if that s what keeps people alive , what s the harm ? indistinct conversations"
"and if we re lucky , we ll never have to think about those skin freaks ever again"
don t wanna play with you anymore if you cheat every time
"well , there s no reason to start shit if we don t gotta"
would you get off my ass before i put you on yours ? sorry if i didn t want my best friend to spend her whole life on a boat
"daryl ? yeah ? you ever wonder if this is all there is ? just run into people , kill each other until whoever s left says enough ? sometimes i think we re just survivin one fight to the next"
"if we get caught on their side of the border , that s it , that s war"
i believe there may be invaluable technological implications for our communities if i m able to retrieve any of the useful bits from inside
"if we get caught on their side of the border , that s it , that s war"
"and i hope that you will because if you can t , i ll have no choice but to leave you behind"
"but if she strays again , i will skin her alive for all to see"
"so , if i m b , what does that make you ? a"
"if she wanted you dead , she d send the horde"
"does anybody else ? if she sends that horde , that s it ! right now , all she wants to do is talk"
but we aren t gonna get through it at all if we do not act as one
"can i look , man , if it s all the same to you , i d rather just stay here and pick tomatoes and bury corpses"
"if you gave a shit , you d leave"
"one truth kept my people going if you don t protect what belongs to you , then sooner or later , it belongs to someone else"
are you saying that eric s death was my fault ? well if i failed eric then you failed your wife
"i mean , if that s okay with you"
or a pair of friendly ears ? alpha said that she would release the horde if we ever crossed her border
"well , that ain t ever gonna happen if she hangs out with you , now , is it ? we were just talking"
"if you run away now , we ll play dumb when they ask us"
if you came here looking for a confession just keep walking
"i m afraid if we don t fix it , it ain t gonna matter what she does to us"
"hey ! if we stay out here , we die"
"if you thought lydia was crazy , why d you agree to meet her back there in the dark ? well , um well hey , we re the ones who were attacked here"
"i don t know if it s gonna make any difference , though"
"should i come home ? no , not if hilltop still needs you"
why didn t she ? you think she won t attack if we got lydia ? alpha wanted you to protect her
"look , lydia s presence might not help us , but if alpha thinks she isn t safe with us or if lydia runs off because of all this , it ll definitely hurt us"
"i look , if you can t make a decision , the people out there are gonna make one for you"
"michonne ? uh , if uh , if you don t mind , i i d love to join you"
who else is gonna be my pair of friendly ears ? yeah
"kept thinking , what if i just stayed in that cell at hilltop ? if i never let myself be taken alive by you people in the first place ? never went off with henry ? never said what i said to my mother ? you re not to blame for her"
"instead of using the extra wood for the addition , what if we made some weapons ? you know , big ones , defensive , couple couple of catapults for the north wall"
"well , who the hell was on watch ? you re hard of hearin when i m whisperin love songs late at night i m used to dinner n drinks but now all we ever do is fight leavin liquor in the laundry cause ya love watching me play hide and seek i m not sure if you heard , but someone stole a crate of fish , the one from oceanside"
it would really help if we all just stuck to the jobs we were given
"you know , if i was lost in the woods , it s the three of them i d want to come looking for me"
"if you don t think they re coming back for worse , son , you re not thinking at all"
"i mean , what are we here for if not for each other ? it was just milo and me"
"it s just , if i go back , everyone s gonna wanna know where i ve been"
"you see , uh , it turns out , not the best co pilot , if you catch my dri you don t catch my drift at all , do ya ? you ve never been on a plane"
"see , if nut tapping were a sport , you wouldn t have to roid up , and you would still be in the hall of fame"
"what else ? i mean , the universe is basically on pause till god gets back"
"i m assuming your mic s out , or else i d hear you laughing your balls off"
"you know , it s scary to think , but kelly probably wouldn t have made it if you guys hadn t have found that stash"
"how s rosita ? ah , same as everybody else , it seems"
"and if you need me to peek at rosita later , just say the word"
"so , you gonna stick around ? well , if you spot somethin , you re gonna need me to track it , right ? i dunno"
"if he is worthy , i will hear him"
"if not , then i kill him"
if you just help me get to the garage so shit
"do you copy ? alexandria , let us know if you are receivin"
"what makes you think they re goin anywhere ? if you and me were whisperers , that s when we d move em"
if that s what it takes sure this isn t you just tryin to take another shot at alpha ? the horde is our shot
"none of this runnin off in the middle of the night , no backup , just us stuff , alright ? since when are we not enough ? you know , we mess this up , everyone else is gonna pay for it , right ? we ve already paid"
this is only gonna get worse if we re not ahead of it
"yeah , if things go sideways , we head back"
"uh , hell , if i had some monster your size , things would ve turned out different"
"i mean , it ain t ego if i really am that awesome"
did you just make a goddamn joke ? i would be impressed if i wasn t so pissed off right now
"this deet exchange on our formatives has been very enjoyable , and at the risk of said humiliation , i wonder if we could dip our toes into some real talk"
"maybe it s better if we let this be , you know , what it is"
what if i were to share specifics ? who s to say i m not a threat to you ? people are dangerous
"i wanna trust you , but if i hear anyone else , i ll know i can t"
"if lydia runs off because of all this , it ll definitely hurt us"
"call me back darlin when you hear me call your name if i don t hear you , i ll think somebody came and if i can t find you , i ll wait on down the hill and if you don t find me , i ll think you been killed and if you don t find me , i ll run on down the road find me the sheriff , tell him what i know find me the preacher and pray for your soul vomits"
"if you wanna sit this out , i get it"
"the whisperer , what else do you know about him ? only that he won t betray my mom"
"what else ? people will die , right ? i hate them"
"but if you let him see what you have here , that a place like this can survive an idea like that is dangerous"
"got some extra , if you d like"
"i mean , if it weren t for gabriel , i would be making my move"
"if we were out there , i would take you like a bitch in heat"
"if he sees that lydia s alive and well , gets it that his great leader lied to him , then maybe that changes something"
"find every excuse to stay out as long as i could , keep going , even if it was just up and down our street"
"gabriel if people find out , they ll panic"
if alpha finds out she won t
and everyone else that loves you
it is not anyone else s
"for a sec , everything else makes sense , right ? well , i m sorry , bro ain t how it works"
i don t care if you re new to us
"i ll listen to what you have , see if it s true , and then we can talk"
"is that what you re doing ? setting us free ? if you learn that lesson , it ll only help you"
"if it s just one scout , i like our chances"
"if you wanna do a great personal history , you ve gotta read a little"

"why ? we were next to a car with an ask me about my grandchildren bumper sticker , and i was afraid if we ran into them on the way out , i d be obligated to do so"

"if you and leonard get back together , sheldon and i will finally have someone to go on double dates with"

"fine , but if i come out of this looking like a dork , it s on you"
"i mean , if you re quiet , you can hear it"
"you threw up ? yeah and the craziest part is , because there s no gravity , the throw up kind of floats there in a little ball , and if your mouth is open because you re screaming sometimes it just floats right back in"
i don t know if you can read his little t shirt
"trust me , if you were even a little conscious right now , you d be laughing"
"with that in mind , if you can hear me , move away from the light and toward the sound of these scissors"

i d make fun of sheldon for having girl problems if i wasn t in shock that sheldon has girl problems
"look , if you don t want to go to the party , just don t go"
"yeah , i always thought if i were ever enslaved , it would be by an advanced species from another planet , not some hotsy totsy from glendale"
"hey , listen , i kind of made plans with the guys this weekend , but then i wondered , because we re in this relationship beta test , if i should have asked you first"
"then i thought if i did check with you first , then you d think that i was taking things too seriously"
"do you mind if i spend the weekend playing video games with the guys ? wha the entire weekend ? you mean i wouldn t see you at all ? but i j no , no i knew what i was getting into"
you made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it
you made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it
"you know , if playing that game is more important to you than honoring your commitment to me , and you don t mind me showing up at a party all by myself after i ve already told everybody i ll be bringing somebody , then , fine"
"uh , if it s yogurt that helps ladies poop , i think raj beat you to it"
"sorry , i just thought it d be nice if people knew we were a couple"

"if he sees the incredible breakthrough i ve made , he ll reach out to me"
what if he doesn t ? he will he s really smart
"sheldon hey , fellas , i m thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some"
"ugh why are you washing howard s man panties ? because if i don t , he won t give my paper to stephen hawking"
"if you don t want to get teased about that , get a doctorate"
"oh , if we squeeze you any tighter , you may turn into a diamond"
"if you could merge with another species , what species would you pick and why ? hint there is a right answer"
"anyway , if it s okay with you , we should talk about howard s bachelor party"
"one agency i spoke to , said i could get us a great price if we re flexible on age range and number of limbs"
"what s going to happen ? i mean , even if there was a stripper , all you d do is avoid eye contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework"

"you know , what if i don t make it back ? it s going to be okay , son"
"listen , if you don t mind , i m not really up for chatting"
"really ? well , if you like it that much , then close your eyes and put out your hand"
"what , i can t propose ? i can t talk to my friends ? is there anything else i m not allowed to do ? all right , that s enough"
"excuse me , i m going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honor"

"i also want you to know , that i will be happy to do it again if this marriage craps out"
"if sheldon proposed to me during sex , my ovaries would grab on to him and never let go"
"on the one hand , i always thought you don t even know what it is , do you ? the anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does , the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question"
"let s not take a saw to the branch we re sitting on , shall we ? hey , uh , if you guys are free tonight , i heard about a spa where you soak your feet in a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them"
"if you weren t busy , i d ask you to join us"
"you know , we could see each other if you turn on the computer"
"i knew it ! i knew she was behind this ! you listen to me , if you want to be a man , you can t let a woman tell you what to do ! okay , okay"

if you don t have the then he might as well be at the coffee bean over on lake street
"would you feel more comfortable if i ate raisinets ? well , it s hardly my business what you eat , as long as it doesn t crunch during the film and it s raisinets"
"if you re going to replace wolowitz , i need to know a little more about you"
"so ? so , if she wants to end her pair bond with leonard , why on earth would she guzzle a witches brew of his soda and spit ? it s complicated"
you can see it if you want
"if i were you , i d get a back up"
"i told him if he didn t bite the hygienist , i d take him for ice cream"
you slept with him ? i didn t know what else to do
"well , if that s all it takes , it s a good thing you don t have a dog"

it s not flattery if it s the truth
"if i die , promise you ll never have sex with another man"
"if my new look leads to phone sex , i m going to have to ask you to leave the room"
"do you think it s appropriate for her to sit with us , given her station ? given her what ? if i ve learned anything from british television shows on pbs , it s that servants dine downstairs with their own kind"
"but meanwhile , the limbic system of your brain is calculating that if another woman is attracted to leonard , it must be because he s desirable"
"if this were a boxing match , they might call it the thrilla adjacent to the amygdala"
"laughs if you were a brain scientist , you would be busting a gut right now ! so , how was work today ? ah , it was all right , i guess"
"anything else ? mmm , the nurse is a woman , so he couldn t talk to her"
"magnets what do they stick to ? if the answer is metal , it s not exactly groundbreaking"
"it s an observational rebuttal of the lambda cdm model of the universe ! no ! it s a chocolate chip cookie ! yes ! how could you miss that ? hey , if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie , you draw a glass of milk next to it"
"and then , finally , if that wasn t enough which it should ve been this is madame curie killing herself by discovering radium , who , although she was a naturalized french citizen , was polish by birth ! excuse me , the word is polish"
"i wonder if it s from , like , ancient rome where they d actually chop somebody s ass off and then go , here"
"if i run too deep a bath , i drown"
"are you sure ? i mean , the nose doesn t light up , but if the corpse is fresh enough , sometimes you can get the leg to jerk"
"wolowitz howard ? i thought i wasn t going to see you till tomorrow ! yeah , well , bernie s not feeling well , so i thought i d stop by , tell you about the greatest adventure of my life , see if you can make me feel bad about it"
"if you re busy , i can come back"
"if he was easy to find , the books would be called there s waldo"
"so ? so , with all those antioxidants , what if i run out of oxidants ? sheldon , we haven t won a game all night"
let me see if i can duplicate the result
"that being said , if you don t get a tardis , you stink and your party stinks"
"if you think being nice will get him to shut up , i ll try it"
what if we were to go as dinner table favorites salt and pepper ? you know salt makes me retain water and my cousin william was ground to death in a pepper factory accident
"no , if i m there alone , people might think i m just a really short person from avatar"
"if i stop talking about it , then i m just just what ? just plain old howard wolowitz again"
"and if they ever come out with a game called words with people you once worked with , you ll be off to the races"
if he s okay with that
"why would you give me a word ? now , if i play extract it would be cheating"
"maybe if it goes well , you take another , you enroll full time"
"maybe later , if you re lucky , you get to sleep with a college girl"
"but if i tell her , she ll know that i read it and she ll get really mad"
"if i fail , i fail"
"if i pass , i pass"
it would appear as if i ve lost him
"yeah , but if he s a sore loser , maybe you re better off without him"
"no , but if i do , i ll be a phony , a sellout , a hollywood poser"
"so , i know this goes without saying , but if either of you tell leonard you helped me rewrite this paper , i will beat you both with a bag of oranges"
"i think if we put our heads together , on the next one we could get an a"
"listen , sheldon , i m really happy to do this for you , but not if she s gonna be a huge pain in the ass the whole time"
that might be a little more convincing if you didn t have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger
"sighs boy , if these walls could talk"
"what brings you in ? penny , if you wouldn t mind , i d like to have a conversation about girls"
"really ? here ? sighs if it makes you uncomfortable , i ll switch partners , even though the thing s due next week and everyone already has a partner and i ll probably end up failing the class"
"what could he be doing in there every day for minutes ? well , he s not doing because if he were , he would have way better abs"
"if you re wondering why i ve been staring through the peephole , i m trying to get a look at this guy who s coming over to penny s"
"what do you mean ? well , if we assume your looks are average , right off the bat , are more attractive than you"

"although , if you wanted to talk to one of them , no one would blame you"
"plus , if i do a good job , he said he d bring me back a sailor s cap"
"well , if it s any consolation , i m sure leonard s tormented every moment he s away from your warm embrace and cherry lips"

"yeah , if your mom could see her little bar mitzvah boy right now , she d have a heart attack"
"if you were having sheldon s baby would you really want him in the room ? yeah , if he s in the room when they re making the baby , i ll give you ten dollars"
"hey , i brought over it s a wonderful life if you guys want to watch it later"
but then he gets to see what the world would be like if he d never been born
"hey , you ever imagine what that would be like ? not being born ? knocking what do you think ? what do you think ? knocking knocking what do you think ? you make jokes about sheldon , but if it weren t for him , i don t think any of us would be sitting in this room right now"
"um what s that ? eh , uh , well , i was wondering if you re not too busy um , uh , if , if you d be interested in telling me where the restroom is ? i think you re too late"
"which couldn t have happened if you didn t live across the hall from her , which couldn t have happened without sheldon"
"if leonard wasn t with penny , she never would have set you up"
"penny , if it weren t for sheldon , you never would have met comic book legend stan lee"
"laughs aw , so i guess if it weren t for me , you d still be living with her , huh ? not exactly"
"there s starving people in africa who know you re starving ! that s it ? ! there s not enough food ! well , you cleaned out earth ! i don t know what else to do ! how is this any different ? you didn t let me finish"
"amy , what about you ? what do you think you d be doing if you never met sheldon ? it s hard to say , my life would be so different"
"and i just thought to myself , sheldon , if you can make it through the green lantern movie , you can make it through this"
"sighs if that were true , i wouldn t still be living alone"
"i m gonna show you something , but if you ever told sheldon he d probably never speak to me again"
"so , if you want to tell him , that s fine"
"you guys need anything else ? uh , your phone number and one more cheesecake"
"if you re really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth , i could set you up with my mom"
"wait , if howard s mother is coming , then you should also steal marbles"
are you set on people laughing with you ? cause if you re cool with at you i don t get it
"i was walking cinnamon and this girl introduced herself , but she was so cute i panicked and said , wouldn t it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each other s butts ? well , stuart s cute in his own way"
"if you re so intimidated by talking to attractive girls , maybe you should practice by talking to regular people"
"so ? even if it is , you have a huge advantage because you re an actual actress"
"do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock knock joke that starts with , knock knock knock , amy , knock knock knock , amy , knock knock knock , amy ? if you want him to stop , sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh"
"look , if you want to break up , just say it"
"laughs so , it s cool if i cry a little ? yeah , i probably wouldn t"
"great , because i ve been thinking , if i really want this acting thing to work , i need to focus all my energy on it"
what if there s a big breakthrough in science today and i m not there to see it ? do you really think there s gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it ? no
"if you can make this happen today , i can hook you up with anxiety medication , antidepressants"
"not so bitey without the rest of the rat to back us up now , are we ? knocking anybody home ? hey , what brings you guys here ? well , we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you d like to join"
"you know , if you d rather skip lunch and hang out with your boyfriend bert , it s totally okay"
"she already thinks i don t support this , so if i call , it might look like i m checking up on her"
"so , anyway , there s this big , uh , rock and mineral show next week in santa monica and listen , um , bert , before you say anything else , i i have a boyfriend"
"i m gonna have to tell him the truth that even if i didn t have a boyfriend , i wouldn t be interested in him"
"okay , if you support me , what was with that phone call ? fine"
"but if you care so much what i think , why didn t you ask me before you did it ? oh , so now i need your permission ? would you have asked me before you quit your job ? yes"
"if i m wrong , then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we re actually in"
i m willing to if you guys are
"for example , where is this going ? are you two ever getting married ? and , if so , where will we all live ? have you thought about that ? no"
"stuart s store is just fine , and he s a much nicer person than you are , and if you still have that comic , i d like to buy it right now ! no problem"
"if you get caught , you get banned from comic con for life"
"oh , all right , if we re gonna be fancy , i should probably put on clean underwear"
"what if we go as the fantastic four , and just tell people that the invisible girl is standing there with us"
"sheldon , i don t care if you get scalped tickets with us or not , but please don t be creepy and go stalking this poor guy"
"not only can you get banned from comic con , if caught , you could be charged with petty theft"
"what if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys , or make a suit out of our skins ? why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin ? i don t know"
"maybe cause dark doesn t show the stains ? well , now you re making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location"
"my friend leonard said if i bothered you while you were eating , you d think i was a creepy stalker"
"okay , so , i m on a comic con message board , and there s a post from a guy where he says he got caught using someone else s badge and sheldon was right he did get charged with petty theft"
"guys if i go to jail dressed as the human torch , that might send the wrong message"
"i i say , this one time , instead of wimping out , let s be badasses ! okay , i ll be a badass but only if you pinky swear to be one , too"
"if he was conscious , he would ve heard me"
what if we do get caught who cares ? so we get banned from comic con
"oh , crap , what if it comes up when i apply for citizenship ? i wonder if we d have to disclose something like this when we apply for grants"
"whispers if he thinks we re not home , he ll go away"
"oh , right ! well my friends and i couldn t get into comic con this year , and i was trying to start my own convention , and i was going to ask if you would be a panelist"
"if we were to share a room , people might talk"
what if my room has a claw foot bathtub ? it doesn t
that would really piss me off if i didn t have a buzz going on
"howard , which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train ? i m sorry , what ? oh , i m afraid if we wear the same pocket watch , it will be embarrassing"
"oh , and i d like for at least one of us to see some action , so if you guys happen to have sex , it s cool if she stays in the room"
laughs don t be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out
"in fact , if you want , we can do it right here on sheldon s spot"
"if you listen carefully when the locomotive disconnects , you ll hear the characteristic click pshht thunk of the knuckle"
"hey , see if you guys can guess this one"
"if she needs new organs , i ll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts ! you re the owner ? owner , father , soul mate , and if anything happens to her , your worst nightmare ! well , she s not throwing up , which is a good sign"
"oh , if she s scared , you can sing to her"
"if you think about it , the q was like the four ten four america never made"
"you know , if you ask nicely , they ll let you visit the engine room"
"hey , did i tell you what happened to me at ups ? as if valentinea s day wasn t bad enough , you try to kill my dog ? ! and with cheap chocolate , no less ? it wasn t cheap"
"here are a few warning signs to look out for , and if you see any of them , don t hesitate to call"
i m sorry if you didn t think we were taking it seriously
"i deserve romance , and i didn t know how else to make it happen"
"well , if you want romance , then let s have romance ! oh , look , there s wine"
"um the conductor said if i come back to the engine room , he d show me how to bring the train through a crossing"
"if i knew it was that easy , i would have considered poisoning you months ago"
"wait , then what is it if you just have hair up here ? you mean a moustache ? moo stache ! he said it ! ha ha , very funny"
"why not get a table ? do you want the long answer or the short answer ? hey , how come we never get that option ? chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system , if the equations describing its behavior are nonlinear , a tiny change in the initial conditions can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result"
"if you ll recall , the vogon fleet blew up the earth anyway"
"well , i don t know if i won that , but at least he s upset"
"and if anything were to happen to you , we will name our firstborn son howard"
"how do i know that you re not manipulating me right now ? i think if i were manipulating you , you d be smart enough to see it"
does it make me an awful wife if i don t think he should do it again ? not at all
"the the spot that you love to sit in , that no one else can sit in , only exists because despite your objections i bought this couch"
"i mean , if you people want to eat at the table , then that s what you should do"
"but if those days are gone , they re gone"
"well , it s not silly if you think of that group as being led by a big , evil baby"
"if anyone s gonna make her feel gross about sex , it s me"
"well , but don t a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies ? okay , i don t think meryl streep ever had to say deep voice must keep gorilla hands from killing again ! if she did , it would be amazing"
"i i don t know anything about show business , so if you think it s reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings , i m sure you know what you re doing"
like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up
"and , if you think it ll help , that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar"
"look , i ll see if i can change her mind tomorrow night"
"look , i admit that it s odd that rajesh didn t write to you himself , but if you get to know him , you ll see he s just a sweet , regular guy"
"rumbling i m sorry for every mean thing i ever did or said to you ! i m sorry , too ! it s all my fault ! rumbling , rattling , passengers gasping if you weren t my friend , there d be a hole in my life ! thank you , sheldon"
"well , i told howie if i wasn t busy , i d spend the night at his mom s"
i think it might be fun to be someone else tonight
"all right , if i m doing this , i m playing to win , so just to be clear if we re ourselves , that means one of us killed stuart ? very good , bernadette"
"ooh , i m gonna check the fridge , and see if there are any clues inside a beer"
"cows may be sacred there , but it doesn t help if you look like one"
"anyway , i was pretty lonely , so i had to make up my own stories and games , and i promised myself if i ever made any friends that that i would play those games with them"
"but if we show up and you re holding them , she ll think they re only from you"
"how can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if i don t tell her how disappointed i am , and that i ll never forgive her ? well , don t do it on the phone"
"and if someone wants to move into my old room , i should at least get a vote"
do do you think we d really drift apart if we both became successful ? of course not
"if i became a famous actress and had to move , you would just come with me"
"but if i get a chance to be a tenured professor , i might not have that much choice in where i end up"
"yeah , but if i become a successful actress , we wouldn t need the money"
"so , wait , if my career took me somewhere else , you might not go ? well sings dramatic stinger he started it"
"okay , if you do something cool in science , you might change the world"
if i become a famous actress i m not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best
even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel
"mother , if you re going to conduct your life in this fashion , then i should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman"
if only there were a solution to that
"if i got the part , it s still the second best thing i ve heard all day"
"apparently , it s mine if i want it"
"emily , right ? yeah i i don t know if you remember me from the dating web site"
"and if it makes you feel any better , you re not the weirdest guy i ve met off the internet"
"so , with my mouth , i said , we re just like anybody else , but with my eyes , i said , straight up , red , hop on my flying carpet"
"and if it s a clear night , i m gonna lay some romantic astronomy on her"
"but what if one of them asks me what i was up to the night before and i was with the other one ? then , what , do i lie ? yes"
"so , what s going on ? well , i m having an impossible time getting my career off the ground , and i got offered a role in this crappy horror movie , and i just don t know if i should take it"
but what if i m wrong ? you know what ? how about i buy it for you ? how about i buy you both ? you know i only have one slot available in my entertainment center
"but which one ? how about this ? i ve heard that if you flip a coin , it will tell you how you actually feel"
sighs i don t know if i can do that
"but if we re really gonna do a double date , then we have to go over some ground rules about emily"
"even if you had yummy candy , i would not get in your van"
"if i wanted to take up a fad , i d get a tramp stamp"
i hope he s this distraught if he ever breaks up with me
"well , if he does , i ll see if my bear has a friend"
"when i got there , i asked if i could use her bathroom"
you know what else i never saw again my security deposit
"if somebody says come in , i m gonna freak out"
"but i think we can all understand how humiliating that was , and i d really appreciate it if we could move on"
let let s go for a walk and and and see if we find a new restaurant
"raj and howard are at howard s mom s , but should we call the girls and see if they want to come ? no"
"well , if you were referring to her illness your question should have been , what ails her ? what ails her ? oh"
"how s your mom feeling ? okay , but she d feel better if she took her medicine"
"i do , but for some reason , emily loves it and wants to watch it with me tomorrow , so i thought if i start with you first , then i could act cool about it with her"
"cause if i had to pick now , i d probably go with dark matter because penny shut up"
"well , my mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity"
"or a nutter butter , if you re in a pinch"
"if i wanted to waste my time on nonsense , i d follow leonard on instagram"
"now , just so you know , i was a nanny for three years , so if you get scared , i can totally change your diaper"
"and watching a bunch of goofy space movies you ve seen hundreds of times isn t ? if we were in a physical relationship , you just lost sex tonight"
"maybe a nice cafe au leia ? and if you re not in the mood for coffee , i can always make you a chai tea po"
"you know , if he were here , i think he d say , enjoy star wars day"
"yeah , howard , i think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favorite we should just get rid of it"
"well , you know what else was just a suggestion ? why don t we change the raisin bran box ? hmm ? and you know who got hurt by that ? every single person who eats breakfast ! wow"
"well , i think more about if i d have any regrets"
"would you feel better if i propose so you could turn me down again ? yeah , i think i would"
"i got into science cause i was always the smallest kid in school , so i thought if i became a scientist , i could invent a formula that made me taller"
"on the one hand , if i say yes this isn t funny anymore"
"wolowitz i don t need a treadmill ! the doctor says you need to get exercise ! i get plenty of exercise ! crushing my will to live isn t exercise ! if she isn t gonna use it , then why are we doing this ? she ll use it"
not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland
thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no
"i mean , look , if we re gonna do this , why not try and make it something we re actually proud of ? clears throat look , sweetie , this movie is garbage , but you should be happy about that , cause if it was a good movie , you wouldn t be in it"
"hey , if you re gonna fire her , then you have to fire me , too"
"you know , i m curious , why are you so upset about seeing emily with another man ? wouldn t you be upset if you saw amy out with someone else ? can t happen"
"i m just telling you now , if we do have kids , don t expect me to do all the work"
"phone dings i have an audition for sharknado ! if i book this , i am totally gonna pay you back for this beer"
and you know what else i m glad about ? i bought you a brownie and i ate it in the car ! mrs
"if i saw you out with another woman , i d be pretty upset"
laughing sighs happily this would have been so much more romantic if you didn t have monkey hair on your finger
"you know , if you re really serious about that , i hear there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat"
"we can t baby sit her well , what if we use our vacation time ? i wanted to go to hawaii , not hell"
i don t know what else we can do
"in any event , while i ve had my misgivings about penny sheldon spoke very fondly of her , and if she is good enough for him , then she s good enough for me"
it doesn t matter if she s okay with you
"good , because not only has that ship sailed , if it hit an iceberg , countless men would perish"
"how could we all live together if i m not there ? look , i i know this is this is change , and that sounds scary , but where are you going to go ? i don t know"
and if it turns out you don t you and i could live together
"if you don t like my cooking , why haven t you ever said anything ? it s hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do"
my mother would kill me if i let something happen to him
"whatever you need , okay ? uh , actually , i was wondering if i could crash at your place for a few nights"
"sheldon , if you really need to do this , i m not gonna stand in your way"
"penny , i wouldn t have put you up for this job if i didn t think you could handle it"
"well , maybe if you called your mother more often , you d know"
"and even if there was , who cares ? they re both adults"
"a who caresa ? ! you wouldn t care if i slept with your mom ? you know what ? you re my best friend , and she s in a bad marriage"
"i i m sorry you don t like my life choices , but it s my life ! well , it s my house , it s my rules ! oh oh ! okay , dad ! if i mow the lawn , can i have my allowance ? hey , don t you take that sarcastic tone with him ! i don t have to listen to you ! don t talk to her like that ! that is my mother wife ! my wife ! i said my wife ! you know what ? this isn t getting us anywhere"
"if you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country , do you know what they would have said ? that i couldn t do it ? exactly"
so what if it didn t all go your way ? that s what makes it an adventure
i wonder if stalin considered any other animals
but imagine how impressed they d be if you showed up already familiar with the material
"if we promote you to junior professor , you ll be able to choose whatever field of research you d like"
"but if i m a professor , then i ll have to teach a class"
what happens if you don t ? then i have to sit through lunch knowing this starfish is having a better day than i am
"that s outrageous ! i know ! if she doesn t do well , th this could reflect poorly on you"
"hey , what if i took your class ? why would you do that ? yeah , why would you do that ? what s wrong with you ? i m thinking about getting my doctorate , and he wants to teach why not ? oh , howard"
"and if you re gonna spend all your time trying to belittle me by making this class unnecessarily hard , then i m out"
"but if you re interested in making a sincere effort to be a good teacher , then i m willing to give this a shot"
"all i do is win , win , win no matter what what are you doing ? everybody hands go up , up and they stay there ! what are you doing ? if you re gonna be a crappy teacher , then i m gonna be a crappy student"
"and call me later , you know , if you decide she s a bitch or something"
"well , if you re going to serve cornish game hen , you should either be familiar with the history of cornwall or be prepared to learn it"
"if you re free tomorrow night , i d love to have you join us on a double date"
"well , if you want , i could help you practice"
"and if there were , we wouldn t be at the bottom of it"
"if you ve got a problem basing a relationship on a contract , i d like to tell you about plucky colonies that entered a a relationship agreementa called the u"
"if i wanted curls for dinner , i d order a clown wig"
what else you up to ? why shouldn t i do it ? there s no upside
"if you do well , no one cares"
"and if you screw up , you re an idiot on youtube forever"
i don t care if we re a ten or a two
leonard it would make me so happy if you said things like that
"if we stay , i ll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead"
"what happens if she doesn t like us ? well , hey , you re my dear friends"
"yeah , even if it turns out you don t have dengue fever , they still let you take a lollipop"
"oh , boy , if there is one thing that gets my goat , those dad gum insurance companies"
"if his butt is so delicate , why doesn t he just use an angora rabbit ? for starters , they shed and bite"
if we could get started
"although it can cause acne , which , if you ask me , kind of increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive"
"if you really want to talk about this , i do have a problem"
"ooh , what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up ? nice"
"you would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dump leonard ? why say it ? yes ! well , i would never leave you off my list , and not just because , without you , we re playing fast and loose with the word a list"
"even if i had slept with him , so what ? everyone has a past"
"amy what if you just hang around and act like her friend until you wear her down ? i mean , next thing you know , you re in her home , you re eating her food , drinking her wine"
"well , maybe people would like you more if you didn t crap all over their ideas"
"why ? because if she hadn t , she d still be wading through the list"
will you stay out of this ? chuckles if only penny had said that once in a while
"i know that if i had a wife or a fianca e , i d ask her first before i invested money in a comic book store"
i just wanted to know if that s okay
"how cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality ? if we could figure out the scientific basis for marty s hover board , that would have universal application"
"what if we don t want to vomit ? oh , you will"
"if future biff goes back to right after he gives young biff the almanac , he could get back to the with marty and doc in it"
"guys do you know that the word a wienera comes from the german name of the austrian capital vienna , or a wiena ? do you know if you look at austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener ? guys , what are we doing ? w we sent the girls away so we could focus"
"if you put a double a battery in there , it makes my leg kick"
"or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials , we could utilize quantum coupling"
"well , i wonder if anyone s tried that"
"what if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic ? like behavior modification ? yeah , exactly"
if only we had one
we want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction
"and if you get in trouble , find a policeman"
"and if he s taking off his pants , he is not a real policeman"
"i got your notes ! i got your notes ! i got your notes ! if you want these , they re gonna be at the strip club ! aren t you gonna chase her ? to the walk in closet ? sure"
"all right , now , one benefit of quantum coupling wait , no , question who decides if someone s gone off topic ? i think it ll be pretty clear"
"if not , we ll take a vote"
if we re leaning towards quantum coupling aah ! why ? you said a quantum coupling
"you know , sheldon , if we apply to be one of those teams , we could be on the ground floor of something big not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well"
"laughs if they get scared , they ll have those hats with the lights on them , cause down there it s night night all the time ! maybe they could ride around in one of those mine carts that go , squeakily ee oo ee oo ee oo"
"well , this is silly so you don t need the car , but you could use it to buy yourself something else , like a new purse to put all this money in"
you re suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it
"if we run into any problems , i ll contact you"
"and if anything bad happens , what s the rule ? save you first come back for raj only if there s time"
"what about the late fees on our credit card because somebody didn t pay the bill on time ? well , maybe i would have paid it if i wasn t also doing everything else around here"
what if we brought them down with us ? we ll take some funyuns
"anything else ? some york peppermint patties , a couple of dr"
"peppers , and run to best buy and see if they have a portable dvd player and season one of a show called hannah montana"
"what ? well , if i do well in sales , i could end up making a lot more money than you"
i want to see if he gets the star
"sheldon , if this is too much , we can stop"
"if you would just use the bucket , you d be so much more comfortable"
"speaking of underwear , i have some interesting news okay , if it s sometimes howie wears yours , leonard already told us"
"okay , what s the big deal ? look , if it helps me make a sale with a physician , i don t think it hurts to flirt a little"
"you know , maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them , i would ve become a theoretical physicist"
"why ? well , what do you mean why ? look , i make more sales if these doctors think i m single"
"if you d like to join in , the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure"
"so , you think she ll be single soon ? oh , if you want to get in on the pool , you re too late all the squares have been purchased"
"well , if it s part of the prom experience , then i m open to it"
"if amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space , well , then , i will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin"
"you know , if you re not gonna learn how to do this , they make some pretty good clip ons"
"if you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket , you d be like the toughest kid on the disney channel"
"so , anything else planned for tonight ? oh , everything"
"we ended up having a threesome with her friend humiliation , so well , if i would have been there and saw you alone , i would ve asked you to dance"
i kind of wish no one else was coming
"sheldon , there s something else i ve been wanting to say , but before i do , i just i want you to know that you don t have to say it back"
i m not even sure if that s a person or a typo
"if it helps you sleep , then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman ? really , leonard insults ? after i spent two hours in your closet , waiting for you to fall asleep ? what s your problem ? if the surgery is successful , the snoring is gone"
and if you die during surgery the snoring is gone
"what re you working on ? remember when i said if you went through with your surgery , there was a one in , chance of dying ? yeah ? well , i ve been crunching the numbers , and so far , i ve gotten your probability of death all the way to a sphincter tightening one in"
"leonard , what if you have an allergic reaction to the surgeon s latex gloves ? i m not allergic to latex"
that is if you make it to the car without falling down the stairs
you know who else said that ? every cocky t
"i if there was an asteroid strike , wouldn t you die , too ? i don t know i m smart and scrappy , i think i d find a way"
"and while you re thinking about it , if you have the surgery in nicaragua during monsoon season , i can practically guarantee your death"
"and if you re cool being the only adults there , they said they are"
"i mean , if you re not up to it , we don t have to go out , we can just hang here"
"amy , he s my best friend , and if you don t take me , i m going there anyway"
"and i wouldn t be able to forgive myself , if something happened to him and i wasn t at his bedside to say , a i told you so"
i would be devastated if my parents split up
"the reason i was being a pain in the b is because i was worried about him , and no one else was"
if we include the one somebody forgot to press record on
"well , but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him ? what if what if this is the thing that would ve finally let him open that bottle of champagne ? maybe he didn t know what to pair champagne with"
"because you don t know how to do cryptanalysis , do you ? i m not even sure if it s the right word"
"i think if you re pulling up your pants , you re not a doorman"
"if i could , i would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you"
"and if you touched the ground , burn you"
"and if i may get serious for a moment , hosting this show has been one crazy ride"
"if you didn t press record i pressed it ! well , that s it"
"what else don t i know about ? uh , well , you know your private bathroom ? yeah ? that was supposed to be for the whole floor"
"what are you doing here ? you told me not to call , and i didn t know how else to give you the good news"
"you know , speaking of attorneys , if i ever needed a lawyer , i would not hire she hulk"
"if you re not up to hosting christmas dinner , i m happy to do it"
"if we were still single , we d be tripping over all that booty"
"okay , how do we catch it ? well , what if we turn off all the lights except for one , and it ll come to it"

"can you please just go and we ll talk about this tomorrow ? i don t understand what you want ! i m trying to figure it out ! you know what ? if you d like , i could whip up a quick relationship agreement"
"are you still fighting ? if you get divorced , do i get two christmases ? we re not getting divorced"
"if you find this draft acceptable , then i believe your new relationship agreement is ready to be signed"
"this includes boxers , briefs , thongs , g strings or anything else that calls attention to his pasty little thighs"
"article , subsection c if questioned , penny may not say that everything is fine if it isn t"
"and , penny , if you could initial here to indicate that you re accepting leonard in as is condition"

"hey , leonard , if you re happy and you know it , no need to clap your hands , because i have an emotion detector"
"leonard , if you re mad about this , just tell me"
"if you were this upset , why didn t you say so when i told you ? because i didn t want to sound like a jerk"
i don t see the big deal if my brother comes and stays for a while
"if you get him a job , he s gonna live here forever ! he would get his own place"
can we storm out ? i think it loses its impact if we re chatting about it
"and if you don t like that machine , get rid of it"

"if he could find a girl with a good job , all his problems would be over"
"and if makeup is so truthful , why is it called concealer ? wait , wait , wait , what s leonard lying about ? he doesn t really want penny to go to comic con"
"well , if you haven t noticed , i ve been between them for the last ten years"
"if you want to drive , just drive"

"why do you ask ? you know , we have the extra bedroom , and if you need it , it s yours"
"okay , well , if i move in , you can t use mine"
"if real dogs gave me buttons , i d like them , too"
"sheldon if you re implying that i d have some problem with him moving into my room , you re wrong"
"well , that s been my room since before i met leonard , and now someone else is going to be living in it"
and that someone else is not me
that s something else to look forward to

"if you want , i can get ready in five minutes"
and guess who else called in sick
"what are you working on ? i was thinking about your experiment on the neuroscience of decision making , and i realized , if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics , we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness in the copenhagen interpretation"
"wait , are you saying if we combine my experiment with your calculations , we can determine the precise moment in time when the wave function collapses ? it could be the most inspired combination since i mixed red icee into my blue icee"
"oh , subsequently , if we win any awards , i speak first"
"sheldon , if we re gonna have ground rules , i ll tell you the first ground rule i make the ground rules"
"well , if your idea of fun is riding in a minivan to target for diapers , things are about to get nuts"

"yeah , boy , if good ideas came out of your brain the way mucus comes out of your nose , we d be in good shape"
"if you don t like it , you should just talk to her"
"grunts just because i am easily bothered by light , heat , sound , smell and the way birds look at me does not mean i m sensitive ! hey , i wonder what kind of success we d have if we defined measurement as the first moment that an action potential is seen by the visual cortex"
what if the fighting is the reason we re making progress ? i suppose it s conceivable that the hormones associated with our fight or flight response could be sharpening our cognitive processes

"you know ? i if it helps , i m not the sharpest dresser"
"hey , leonard , if you re not busy tomorrow , i have to do a little reception after work"

"can you not tell howard ? well , don t you think it d be healthier if you told him what s going on with you ? don t you think it d be healthier if you had your own apartment , grown man ? your secret is safe with me"
"sneezes you know , there was a time i would say god bless you , and then you would say if you must invoke an imaginary deity , how about thor ? and i would say , how do you know i didn t mean thor ? and then you would say toucha , and that there ends the tale of why i no longer say god bless you"
"if i saw her on the street i d say , damn , that girl s fine ! sheldon , you re sick , go back to bed"
"howard , i m sorry if i m being weird , but it has nothing to do with you"
"if i go back to work , i m abandoning halley"
"if i don t go , i m giving up everything i worked for"
"but whatever we choose , if we re not happy , we can undo it"

"now , before we field test , i think we what the hell ? where is everything ? who else has access to this room ? it s a secure lab in a classified facility only the u"
"if that s sarcasm , please save it for our enemies"
"although , if anyone s gonna clean out your apartment and disappear , it d be penny"
"can we just talk about something else ? yeah , what s going on with you guys ? give us some good news"
"look , if the roles were reversed , he d be on the first train to new jersey , or the second train if there were teenagers on the first one"
"i know , but what if sheldon okay , listen to me"
"i m telling you , if you don t go you ll end up regretting it"
"i don t know if you realize this , but whenever you re between projects , you tend to get a little insecure"
"uh , i know it s not your birthday , but if you re interested i am"
"well , no , it s just , i m just warning you , you know , if you find yourself , miles away and craving a a hit of this , you know i can t skype it to you"

"if they don t want me to quit , this is what it s gonna take"
"it s like you said , i have to go after what i want , and if i can t get that at caltech , there are plenty of other universities in the world"
"w in the world ? laughs i can t even get you to go to the beach , and now you want to move to the world ? well , i don t want to , but if that s what i have to do okay , don t you think threatening to quit your job is something you should run by me first ? you said i shouldn t worry about your feelings"

"no , i just thought if you thought we weren t doing the right thing , that s why you might think that"
"well , if i did think that , you might point out that people who claim it s okay to do bad things to win are bad people no matter what they tell themselves"
"well , if she was smart enough to know that , she wouldn t still be working at a cheesecake factory"
"yeah , but what if they don t win ? uh , pemberton and campbell have done an amazing job of associating their names with super asymmetry"

"and if that means getting my hands dirty , so be it"
what if i look at it and decide not to use it ? i had not considered that
"sheldon , if someone were gonna do something ethically murky on your behalf , would you rather know about it or not know about it to retain your innocence ? well , now that i know there s a thing to know , i have to know"

"okay , if we re at the le , then i say we follow it up with a t s go home"
"it could happen ! and so , really , what s it gonna matter in years if i jump the gun by one night ? look , i know this is a moral gray area , but it s robin"

"i know these things aren t much fun , but it would really mean a lot to me if you guys came"
"barney , i m not bringing a date even if i wanted to"
you know what else is in that locker room ? a bunch of naked dudes hanging brain
"and , who knows , maybe we will wind up getting married someday , you know , if we can get a blessing from her pimp"
"do you think , hypothetically , it would be weird if i bring a date ? look at you , scherbatsky , blatantly trying to make ted jealous"
"but if you re not interested , fine , i m out bucks"
"well , it s just an internship for the record for everybody yeah , because if i did sacrifice all my values just for an easy buck , what would that make me ? a prostitute"
have you kissed her yet or are you waiting until you re in a serious relationship with someone else ? yeah
and you know what else ? i didn t come here tonight to make you jealous
"and , you know , if ted likes her , she s probably pretty cool"
"okay , seriously , what is going on with ted , lately ? is he having a nervous breakdown ? you know , barney , for anyone else this would be a new low , but sadly , for you , it s just a new middle"
"in keeping with tonight s award show motif , i d like to announce this evening s big twist ending"

"even if a dinosaur should poke his head out of my butt and consume this coffee table , i need you to roll with it , okay ? wow"
"once you re married , if we go out , and you get so drunk you throw up , it ll be sad , but if we do it tonight , it ll be less sad"
i was wondering if you guys could play good feelingby the violent femmes
"i know it s probably not in your repertoire , but i m getting married and my fianca wants to hire you guys as the band , but i can t sign off on it until i hear you play good feeling because that s our song , and what kind of wedding band would you be if you couldn t play our song , right ? right ? look , i m kind of wasted right now , so i didn t understand any of that"
"but if you get us the sheet music , we ll play your song"
"hey , if i got in a fight , would you have my back ? you know it"
"well , look , if you absolutely must bring ted , it s not like i m going to claw my own eyes out if he comes"
"i want to live in france and spain and italy and just soak up life and put it on a canvas , even if it means being a waitress in crappy cafa s for five years , i don t care"
"if i m going to marry someone , she has to be perfect"
"well , look , if you would just help me fill out these forms , that would be great"
"but i love painting , and i ve always wondered if i m any good"
i just i just really wanted to see if i could get this
i just need to know if i can get in
"if i do this interview , and get into the program , then i ll know , and i can forget all about it , and get married"
"so , really , the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake because then you d go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not"
what else ? she loves lasagna
what else ? let s see what else
"anybody else get chills ? look , i realize we ve been down this road before , but the fact is , whatever i do , it all keeps coming back to robin"
"one more big , beautiful , stupid , romantic gesture if it s no , then i am done going after robin forever"
"i mean , what if we do this and it doesn t work out and i d lose you as a friend ? i gotta think about this"
"if you want me to say yes right now , i can t do that"
"well , if it s not yes then it s a no"
"if an act of god is what it takes , then an act of god it is"
"if it doesn t rain this weekend , she s gonna end up with the wrong guy"
"i never said that ! you know , if you re having these kind of doubts now , what s gonna change in three months ? maybe we just shouldn t get married at all"
"what if you decide to go be a painter , and then you realize i don t fit into your life anymore , and three months becomes forever ? can you promise me that that s not gonna happen ? marshall cause if you can t promise me that , we should just break up right now"
and the only way that i can do that is if if we don t talk for a while
ted it is if you call her when she asked you not to you re just going to look weak and you re going to regret it
"so , did you hear the big news ? you mean how lily and marshall broke up , and lily s gone and nothing else even remotely important happened last night , yeah , i think he knows"
and i don t even know if she s coming back
"hey , thanks and , hey , if you need anything day or night , just call me you know what , please don t call me"
"i have to go down there , and i have to tell her i love her i have to beg her to take me back , even if i have to get down on my knees"
"but if you go down there right now like this , you re going to blow it for him , and he s never going to forgive you"
is it still okay if we borrow the car ? bold
"but she told me that if it wasn t for me , you would have had a shot with her , so , in hypothetical terms , you scored last night"
"i m third year at columbia law , so if the workload does kill you , i can probably get a conviction"
"that first apartment , i i waited too long and somebody else got it"
i wonder if it s because it reminds you of something else you lost because you couldn t commit
"it s my card ! stop ! hold on ! if we can t settle this like gentlemen , then no one gets the number"
i d take you with gravy if my boyfriend wasn t sitting right here
"whoo ! look , if you want marshall back so bad , how come it took you two days to even ask about him ? i was dying to ask"
"if you called him up , yeah , he d take you back with open arms"
"look , if you re going to go back to him , i don t want to hear the word maybe"
"if things had gone your way you d gone out a couple times , i think she definitely would have had sex with you"
"what if i told you that you could relive that night with the exact same conversations , the exact same jokes only this time , you get her and i don t"
"now , if you ll excuse me i have two unique breasts and two duplicates waiting for me"
"listen , if there s anything i can do to even begin to make things up to you actually there may be something that you can do for me , but you can never ever ask me why"
"okay , if you don t , i will"
"lily , would you like to join us ? um what ? well , i i don t want to go if it would make you uncomfortable"
"well , yeah , i d say that , too , if i had those skinny little chicken legs"
"it is kind of warm in here , though , isn t it ? oh , i don t know , if anything , it s kind of what are you doing ? oh , nothing"
"okay , if you don t , i will"
"isn t she sweet ? well , if she s so sweet , maybe she should have ted s babies"
"okay , if you don t , i will"
"and if we don t get it , we could go under"
"oh , dude , if they re selling condos , you got to get me in"
"if it was me , i could ve designed something amazing"
"and if he s really droning on , you can always practice saying the alphabet backwards"
"can we talk about something else ? you know what , dude ? forget about robin , okay ? you re hanging with us tonight"
"if it were me , i d be like ted mosby , architect"
"if a guy told you he was an architect , what would you think of that ? are you kidding ? architects are hot"
"carl , do you really want to be with a woman who would trade sex for beer ? only if you re into it"
"if you want , my friend marshall invited me to this party we could all go to"
"her name wasn t on your lease , was it ? cause if not , new york state law , you re not obligated to give her half the deposit when you move"
let s see if it s unlocked
"girls , i got to go , but i m leaving you in very good , if slightly sullied hands"
"if you trim that back , the rest would look bigger"
"spare key , brilliant ! i m sorry , but you know i d only come here if i had no other choice"
"that counts as changing something ? lily , if i wanted a fridge full of groceries , or fresh coffee in the morning , i d be in a relationship"
"and if that doesn t drive them away , there s always your life sized storm trooper"
"well , if you really wanted to sell this ruse , we should try to make this place a little more you know , homey"
"hey , if my bed s going suit up , it s going to do it right"
"even if you don t believe it , tell me he looks fat"
"if you re watching them bounce , she s about to pounce"
druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own
"if something goes wrong , yell out , who wants espresso ? so i ll know he s coming"
"maybe , if you start being nice , i ll come back"
"if not , other things in your office may follow my lead"
"and , if the thief doesn t believe me , well , then you are gambling more than pete rose major league baseball s all time hit leader , a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world ever allegedly did ! wow"
"all right , i ll give it back if you show him your plans"
"seriously , none of this would have happened if it weren t for you"
"hey , i m project manager now , so , if you want your old job back no , thanks"
"well , what if the heart doesn t mean anything ? what if she writes it on all the cups ? mine says ted , no heart"
"well , if anything , that s dad s fault"
"i should invite marshall , right ? it d be weird if i didn t"
"if i pulled you aside , i wouldn t need the look"
"well , maybe if it was a more distinctive look okay , the look isn t important"
"i mean , what if he falls in love with her ? well , if it makes you feel any better , ted says she has the crazy eyes"
"well , did did ted say whether she was good looking ? i mean , cause if i knew she was ugly , then maybe i wouldn t be so freaked out"
"if you two are ever gonna get back together , you have to let him work out whatever this is"
"wait , if you were the hunchback , then why did she think you were a guy ? i i might have used a voice that sounded like this"
"oh , my god , that is so fantastic ! i i don t know if i can just leave work"
"uh , if there were any shame in a dude getting a pedicure i don t think there would have been a feature about it in details magazine"
"look , i don t know what to say , but if you guys don t want to book a wedding for monday or play a round of keno , i can t help you"
"oh , really ? ! is what i would say if i could waive the waiting period , but unfortunately , only a judge can do that"
"really ? ! is what i would say if there was any chance of you seeing a judge today , which there isn t"
"okay , lil , why is it so important to do this today ? because if we don t do it today , i just know we re gonna wind up having a huge wedding with a huge crowd full of huge midwestern people looking all disapproving and judging me while sipping little cups of mayonnaise and and cracking runaway bride jokes all night long"

"if there is some potential oh moment , i want to know about it right away"
"you know what it might be ? this is going to sound a little crazy but what if robin is married ? married ? what does that have to do with the mall ? well , maybe she got married at the mall"
"what are my powers ? um , if a problem arises and we need a ruling , that s your job"
"what if i just ask robin point blank if she has a husband ? you said you would respect her privacy , so maybe you should just drop it"
"because he s crazy , right ? i mean , how crazy is that ? are you asking me if i m married ? well , you can ask me"
"do i ask her to get a divorce ? ted , even if she is married , it s a canadian marriage"
"you know what , in some countries , if you been separated for longer than five years , technically , you re no longer married"
if i have to sit through one more flat chested nova scotian riding a mountie on the back of a zamboni i ll go out of my mind
"look , i appreciate what you re trying to do , but if it s out there , there s no point in trying to hide it anymore"

"could it be that before marshall took a swim , someone else tested the water ? no"
"nobody else tested the water , right ? scooter ? who s scooter ? my high school boyfriend , who i did not have sex with"
"okay , but if relationships are like a freeway , then saying hm hm hm is like getting into the carpool lane"

are you kidding me ? what if somebody sees it ? we re not in high school anymore
"oh , no , what s the matter , marshall ? where is it ? i ll tell you where it is if you ll answer these riddles three"

"what if i told you i had a way to pay for our honeymoon ? baby , our honeymoon s already paid for"
"well yeah , but but what if we didn t want to spend our honeymoon in a cave ? it s not just a cave , it s a whole labyrinth of caves"
"well , what if i found a way to make a little extra money so that we spend our honeymoon not in howe caverns , but in scotland ? loch ness ? yeah"
"if i were a woman , i d have passed it long , long ago"

"ted , it s not a drinking game if you drink anytime anything happens"
"what else can we bet on ? nothing , it s the halftime show"
"if i don t handcuff myself to this radiator , i ll check the score"
"but unfortunately , the city won t be fixing the unusually large pothole any time soon , so buckle up if you re on the bqe"
"oh , um , that s great , but i really don t want to know , so if you could just keep that to yourself"
"right ? ! right ? ! no ! and if that weren t bad enough , i was about to have a horrible realization"

"if we miss this flight , it s all barney s fault"
"you know , barney never would have run the marathon in the first place if marshall hadn t broken his toe"
"i mean , if you don t show up at the apartment in the middle of the day , marshall doesn t break his toe , barney doesn t run in his place , i don t jump the turnstile and get a court date , and we make our flight in plenty of time ! and i don t fall down and bite my tongue at the airport"
i wouldn t have walked in on marshall if it weren t for lily

"if we point it out , we re gonna ruin her for him"
"marshall , what is everyone s problem with cathy ? oh , she s a total nightmare , ted , but can we talk about this later ? i m a minute away from finding out if i m gonna be a lawyer or not"

"if i have to wait six weeks to find out if i passed , i m gonna have a heart attack"
"if it s so obvious and you guys all see it , how come i don t ? cause we re not trying to have sex with her"
"he was a talking pig and he was like bah , ram , ewe ! what what if there was a sorority , bah , ram , ewe ? i d totally rush it"
is there a reason that you re acting like this ? we re about to find out if you re a lawyer
"so i hope you passed the bar because if we use this software , the night janitor gligor who i fooled into putting fingerprints on my computer , is going to need a good lawyer"
"if anything , it s more of a catchword"
"actually , if he practices law in another state , he will have to , but new york , man ! it s a great state to practice law in ! lawsuit up ! but if you love them enough , those bad habits are easy to forget"
"well , he didn t have anywhere else to go , and i didn t know what to say"
"why are you guys even a country ? oh , hey , by the way , if anyone wants to come over early thursday , we can watch the slapsgiving day parade"

"and if you have sex again , neither of you gets dessert ! oh , what the hell kind of thanksgiving is this anyway ? um , most thanksgivings"
"if that s cool ? today , lily did something great"
i think that s pretty amazing if you think about it
"wow , i can t decide if i m thoroughly disgusted or really , really impressed"
i ll drive to vermont and have a commitment ceremony to my body if you want
"so , patty , know that new paperboy ? i let him throw one into my hedges , if you know what i mean"
"did you see that new guy who cleans my pool ? i let him snake my drain , if you know what i mean"
"i know we haven t seen each other for a while , but if there was any chance oh , boy"
"if you re too scared , i can call her"
and if anyone sees heidi klum dibs
"even if you screw up , you ll never know"
i don t know what else is
"yeah , it was hard at first , but now if i go a day without working out , i miss it"
"oh , but ted , if you get rid of the butterfly , how s everyone gonna know you re a stripper from reno with daddy issues ? yes , yes , enjoy these final moments of mockery because in just ten surprisingly expensive sessions , stella is gonna zap that butterfly right off the face of my lower back"
"if it s someone you see on a regular basis , and you can t avoid them and in this case , you re paying them then yes , it counts"
"so if you ll excuse me ted , barney has a point"
"if he were missing some teeth , i probably would ve already hit that"
"you call the cops if you haven t seen them in a while and you smell something funny , and that is it"
"if you screw over wendy the waitress , you re going to kill the bar"
"if it seems at all weird , i ll back off"
"yeah , listen , i m leaving so , if you want to write the rest of these down , i will read it tomorrow"
marry her if you have to
"other girls and you , if you re into that"
"if you need anything else , let me know"
"you are such a jerk ! ted , have you not been listening ? attraction , bargaining , submission , perks , tipping point , purgatory , confrontation , fallout ! these things will all happen to you as surely as they happened to all of us ! it s a rule of nature ! well , i m sick of all the rules ! there s too many of them ! the hot crazy scale , the lemon law , the platinum rule if everyone in the world followed every one of your rules , the human race would cease to exist"
you re welcome to join us if you want
"look , if it was just you two , you could go in right now"
"uh , excuse me ? are the girls in there hotter than our dates ? i don t know if they re hotter , but they re drunker"
i m gonna check the other rooms to see if the previous owners left us any free stuff
"if lily finds out her new dream house is crooked , it s gonna it s gonna break her heart"
"all right , i m gonna try something , and if this works uh , hey"
"now we wait , see if something good happens oh ! hello ! st"
"if you re not wearing green , you got to get pinched"
"but , robin , you re a skeptic , so if you say you saw a ghost it passed right through me , and suddenly i felt cold , so very cold"
"because if there is a tomorrow , i m gonna be in a lot of trouble"
"i m telling you , if you want to know how old a woman is , check her elbows"
"there s three rules of cheating it s not cheating if you re not the one who s married , it s not cheating if her name has two adjacent vowels , and it s not cheating if she s from a different area code"
"oh , and her husband letting her out alone on saint patty s day ? if that dude s not , i m"
but then what if we want to read those books ? this is a nightmare
"if we have a daughter , we ll have to call her eileen"
"if i make it through the door , that s five points"
"are the girls in there hotter than our dates ? i don t know if they re hotter , but they re drunker"
"and it s gonna take some time , too , so it looks like you re stuck with us for a little while longer , if that s okay"
"and it s a good thing i didn t , cause if i had met her , i don t think she would have liked me"
"if you don t believe me , it s playing down at the pamela theater"
"all right , so if you re not allowed to date a patient , i ll just i ll wait until these ten session are up and then i ll ask you out then"
"and yet you can say with absolute confidence that ten weeks from now , if i ask you out on a date , your answer will be no"
"i know , i know , but i thought if i read it , maybe we d have something new to talk about"
"can you stop talking about your other patients ? ! i m dying here , woman ! look , even if it is something , it s easily treatable , so try to relax"
"but if you ever do wake up with , like , a dolphin tattoo on your ankle , just give me a call"
"but i understand that you really don t have time right now , but if you ever do , will you give me a call ? yes"
"well , then if it s fixed , can we have sex on it and then go shopping"
"look , if you want to figure out who it is , why don t you just start by checking your list ? my list ? dude , do not pretend you re not the kind of guy who keeps a list of all the girls he s slept with"
"when she comes out , i m gonna hide , and once you figure out if she s the girl from the bar , we run like hell"
"what do you mean , no ? that woman , like every woman in your final four , deserves an apology , and i m not telling you if she s the one until i hear you say , i m sorry"
"oh , crap , there she is ! if she sees me , she s gonna kill me ! here s what we re gonna do"
"hey , meg ! over here ! look who it is ! your old friend barney ! barney ? if she kills me , i want you to go into my apartment , grab the metal briefcase under my bed and throw it in the east river"
"right , and if you recall , her computer had a web cam and a t line , so i yeah , i know , barney , you showed me"
"if you re here to ask me to take down the web site , forget it"
"and if you ditching holly in the woods made her stop running around with guys like you , then cheers"
"look , i can do this , okay ? i mean , how else are you going to find out who this girl is"
"if crap could eat and then crap stuff out , it s that ! your report is the crap that crap craps ! if you last two more days here , i ll be shocked ! shocked ! it was brutal , but the worst was a few minutes later"
how the hell am i supposed to face this guy again ? here s what i would do if i were you
"you made yourself look bad , you made this company look bad , and quite frankly , you made our friends , the north koreans , look bad ! and i ll tell you something else , blauman , if you think for one you know what , bilson ? you can kiss my ass"
"but arthur , in the future , if you want someone to do their best work , try to motivate them , not with fear and intimidation , but through encouragement , inspiration and respect"
"how long have you been sitting there ? if you go in there with lily s kindergarten nonsense , you re gonna get torn apart"
"yes , you do , or else that anger is gonna eat you alive"
"guys , i m telling a life altering story here ! a tip , really , for that waiter ? i don t know , barney , he worked a triple it just i can t believe you know what ? if you re not gonna yell at the waiter , yell at me"
"bob barker s not your father ! you ve concocted this delusional idea that a game show host is your real father , and he s not ! you were abandoned , barney ! you were abandoned , and you never dealt with it , and so now you never allow yourself to feel anything , and that s how you survive in this corporate world , and if i keep heading down this path , i m gonna turn into you ! and i don t want that ! i don t want any of this ! this is not why i became a lawyer"
louise marsh ? ! that s a whore s name if i ever heard one
"if i m not sitting in that stool at the top of the slide , going go go go people die"
"i mean , if i was actually another kid just went , now you ve got a pile up and robin s got something to report on the news"
"i ll give her a call , see if she wants to hang out"
i d even consider not trying to sleep with her if that s what it takes
"if i was your mom , i would say , we forbid you from seeing this boy"
"you re not going to that show tonight ! oh , yes , i am , and you know what else ? tonight , after the show , simon and i are going all the way ! young lady , get back here ! thanks for your help"
"it was the greatest week and a half of my life we used to go to the beach you know , if you reedit it , there s a tampon commercial in here somewhere"
"is it my imagination , or are these drinks getting smaller ? if this were a doctor s office , they d say , try again"
"for one thing , i m fairly certain that if these contracts aren t executed precisely , we will be at war with portugal"
"bro code article the mom of a bro is always off limits , but the stepmom of a bro is fair game if she initiates it , and or is wearing at least one article of leopard print clothing"
so what if i did ? there s no rule against it
"but if you , my lawyer , can find a loophole somewhere , then that bad feeling will go bye bye"
"barney , i m no shrink , okay , but don t you see that this is just a desperate way for you to avoid an unpleasant confrontation with ted ? if i wanted a psychological evaluation , i d hire the guy we pay to hypnotize us before depositions"
"wait how about this ? ted s probably broken this thing himself , right ? and if he s broken the bro code , then i m off the hook"
and the only way you re ever gonna feel any better about it is if you tell ted what you did
"what if he never wants to talk to me again ? well , i guess that s just a chance you re gonna have to take"
"i don t know if you d even want it , but if you do , it s yours"
and i think i d actually prefer it if you were mad at me this is too weird
"look , i m crazy about this girl , and if waiting is what it takes , then i am fine with that"
"five years ? god , if i even went one year , i would be out on the street selling it for a nickel"
"well , ted , what else did she say ? did she give you any kind of explanation ? look , after lucy was born , i dated a little , but it was hard to find a guy i could trust enough"
i don t want you to ever wonder if i was worth it
i would explode if it had been that long since i had a night out
"and even if you got randy laid tonight , would it feel anywhere near as meaningful as when you got ted laid ? he was just so happy the next morning , you know ? i know"
"that s it ? as far as i m concerned , if i leave you safe on dry land with adequate transportation home , you ve got nothing to complain about"
"if i were to say ted could never pull them off , what would i be talking about ? his red cowboy boots"
"i have some leads on a job , but until then , i just i don t know what else we can do"
"so , if i can sell three of my paintings at bucks a pop , then i get to keep all my clothes"
"yes , and you can still enjoy it even if you re not a pretentious douche"
"if you sell that , i m going to take your money and go buy some more heroin"
you know what you should do ? you should call up the g cwoks and offer them a free painting if they throw a private art party for all their g cwok friends
"well , if you didn t want the painting , can i can i at least get it back ? yeah , no , we don t have it anymore"
"i know it sounds crazy , but for all i know my life would be very different if i had taken , say that cab"
god knows what would have happened if i had gotten into that cab
"if i m having these feelings now , what if they don t go away ? what if they just get worse and worse and six months from now , i break up with her over tofu salmon at her sister s wedding ? i can t do that to her"
you d want to know if this happened to him
not even if you boiled it in detergent
"miracle ! yeah , you know , i bet if you call up the vatican , they will tell you that most of their certified miracles involve dry humping so"
"hey , kids , who wants uncle marshall to get his old job back ? they ll cheer for anything if you say it like that"
"sir , if you could just see your way into giving me one more chance , i promise marshall"
"if it weren t for the lice , i would have gotten my job back , and i would have been working there when , two weeks later , the securities and exchange commission came a knocking"
"like when the waiter comes around and asks if you want any more muffins , and you say , we re good"
"if you had those feelings once , then you re going to have those feelings again , and you re going to keep on having them"
"if you re here to come crawling back , just save it"
"i had to look away because if i watched what the paramedics were about to do , i would have passed out"
"if there s anything i ve taught you over the years , it s barney , he left"
"what s up , turd ? it s ted ! but if you re lucky , she may answer with the single greatest word in the english language"
"that s like saying , how can an ant carry times its body weight , but root beer floats are still delicious ? are the two even related ? really ? barney , you re going to have to stop screwing around if you want to be robin s boyfriend"
but only if you stop sleeping around
"how did you know that ? ok , let s my think , what else ? you know what , sweetie ? i woke up so early and i had a really long day at work"
"robin , i was wondering if nothing"
"what if you show it to her , she doesn t like it ? dude , it s just a movie"
"it s just a movie ! awesome minutes later if stella doesn t like this movie , i can t marry her"
"and barney , april asked if tomorrow , you could hit a goal for her during the baseball match"
"well , what if i do , ted , all right ? i don t have a switchblade"
"why ? why ? do you know where it is ? and if you tell me it s at the corner bistro , i m gonna smack you right in the face ! we don t , we don t know where it is"
"no ! robin ! if any of us is gonna eat a burger tonight , it s gonna be the best burger in new york"
you know what else is a mouthful ? all that double talk other banks give you
"no , if marshall says this isn t the burger , this isn t the burger"
"if you get there first , medium rare"
"i guess i just kind of thought that if i could have that burger one more time and feel that way for one more night , that i might be able to check that off the list , and grow up , go work for the stupid bank , and just be happy"
"wow , if only there were an easy , convenient way to get some cash right now"
"if he does get that burger pregnant , i have dibs on the delicious burger babies"
"ted , if you murder me , and bury me in new jersey i ll haunt you for ever"
but if i murder you and bury you in somewhere else ? i ll leave you alone
"friends hanging out , isn t that would really matters ? okay , if we take the next train , we could be at maclaren s by ! we can be there by ? no , i have to change first , i m not walking into maclaren s smelling like new jersey"
"but , no robin , if you call him right now , you will hate yourself look , i have slept with lots of women who afterwards told me off and stormed out"
"but if you could see that look , actually , you can see that look , there s a video"
"sorry , i know , okay ? if you don t hang up right now hey , joel , it s robin"
"okay , look , as much as i want to see college boy here wet himself on camera , if you can get here in time to read the news , you can have your old job back"
"i know it s scary to bet on yourself , but if you don t , nobody else will"
how can it be end of discussion if there s never been a discussion ? this is part of being a parent
"ted , do you know that once , an old lady actually called me a bitch and threw a cat in my face ? and you want to know if that happened in new jersey ? right in front of your beloved little papaya king"
barney is crazy if he thinks this is gonna work
"but if you look at that squished together ae symbol in this here encyclopaedia , you ll learn that it s a ligature derived from the anglo saxon rune you know , you re gonna have to paedia for that"
yeah ? i ll give you bucks if you can shoot it through this front door
"i mean , if i get married and move to the suburbs , in the blink of an eye , i ve become an old man ! why , hello , young lady"
"if someone had given me that advice , well , it would have changed everything"
with everyone else not far behind
i wouldn t care if you did
"yeah , but what if there s no next crisis ? she s a bride"
"and kids , if i had just let stella talk to robin , this whole story might have ended differently"
"i don t know , i i just thought if i ever changed my mind about marriage and kids , it was it was nice to know that you were there"
"but after all that , this is how your great romantic quest comes to an end ? you re just disappearing into someone else s wedding , someone else s house , someone else s life without a second thought"
if you really feel that way i guess it s a good thing you re not coming to the wedding after all
"kids , sometimes you think you re living out one story , but the truth turns out to be something else entirely"
if only i d understood what the real story was
i wasted years trying to get lucy s dad to decide if he was ready for this
"listen , if ted were married right now , he d be married , he d be living in new jersey , and he d be married"
"anywhere else , though"
"and if the pain starts to come up again , we push more pain down on top of it"
"we take our feelings and we shove them in somebody else s face ! oh , spare me , lily"
you d be doing the same thing if you were in this situation
"as if , sasser"
"but if gasser michael walked in right now , as hard as it would be , i would go up to gasser michael and i would resolve things between us"
we re just gonna be eating down here if that s okay
"there are a lot of people i don t want to see people of the chicks i banged persuasion but if any of them were to walk in here , i would stand up , and i would look them right in the eye"
"if she ever got clingy , the armed guards stopped her"
"what ? yeah , if the last person i wanted to see walked through the door , i wouldn t say a damn word"
"but if she s going home , why are we still heading oh , my god"
"if one of my little michael phelpses got loose , he s swimming for the gold"
"so , if we have a baby , do you think you could work fewer hours ? doesn t matter he s gonna be so cute , i m gonna eat him up on the first day"
they realized if they were going to start a family they had to plan ahead
"but , god if you could get me out of this , i swear i will never ever , ever , ever , ever , ever , ever i ooh , hang on , bro"
"you re creating a holiday ? yeah , why not ? everyone else gets a day mothers , fathers , bastilles"
you know what else is huge ? marshall s head
"marshall s always at the office , and , and i m afraid that if we have a baby now , all the work will fall on me"
"if you don t , you ll always regret it"
"and then , come on , the soft spot ? if there s gonna be a self destruct button , at least hide it somewhere it won t accidentally get pressed"
you know what ? maybe i should find somewhere else to stay this weekend
"li , if you would all please open to page five of your merger documents"
"would you excuse me just for a brief second ? did anyone else see the drunk chick ? hey , you guys didn t have to it s a picture of me with no kids"
"bilson , with all due respect , it would be terrible if a job that could go to a hard working american architecture firm went to a bunch of french guys"
do you realize what a hero i would be if i brought this project to my firm ? and that s not even the best part
"i don t know if you re familiar with the rie technique , but it derives from the progressive educational philosophy of rudolf steiner , who founded the waldorf school , which oh , my god"
"if there were no woo girls , there d be no girls gone wild , no bachelorette parties , no las vegas poolside bars all the things that you hold dearest , lily , would be gone"
"but who would woo , lily ? who would woo ? would you ? would you who wants to name my boobs ? ! now if you ll excuse me , i have a date with hannity and colmes"
"what the hell is the matter with you ? ! this is ted s big break ! and then you sold him out because you wanted to work in the brain of a tyrannosaurus rex , which , incidentally , if you knew anything about dinosaurs , is really , really small"
"i cry in the shower ! i ve never been on a second date what if i never get to be a mom ? i m secretly in love with jillian ! my career and love life are heading nowhere oh , those poor girls a and ted"
"actually , i wonder if it s not too late to no ! the point is you got the job"
"hey , you going to ride the bull tonight ? no , not if you paid me"
"jillian , you know what d be really crazy and funny and stupid to do tonight ? if you and me find a guy and have a three way"
maybe if we found the right guy
"yeah , and if we don t find the right guy , maybe you and i could just you know who was pretty cute ? that guy ted"
"now , kids , if you want to go swimming , you don t just dive in"
"like if a normal girl were seven , seven and a half feet tall and wore a denim miniskirt"
i have nothing else to offer you
"and if i see him again , i m calling the cops"
"now , if you ll excuse me , i need to replace one of my fantasy football quarterbacks"
"okay , you two lovebirds ! let s take this somewhere else , this booth s reserved"
"ladies , if you ll please adjourn to your usual booth"
"if a guy can throw down , it s somewhat way hot"
"and scars , hello ! if a guy s got a scar , he s got a robin"
and if he s missing teeth ? i m missing my pants
if you come to school tomorrow and tell them your story of choosing the path of nonviolence it might really set them straight
"seriously if i don t come out of there completely ripped ted , we can t go to prison ! people get shivved in the joint ! plus the meals are really starchy"
"what if we didn t ? didn t what , ted ? didn t beat up those guys"
what if doug beat up those guys all by himself and we didn t do anything ? i knew it ! i knew it ! i knew it ! i knew it ! you guys didn t throw a single punch
"look , can you just help us get out of this ? you know the old expression if you re not prepared to do the time don t pretend to do the crime and laugh and get free drinks and not stand up for your friend who incidentally , has been in plenty of fights with his brothers"
"we re the three musketeers ! if i give up ted , how much time am i looking at ? hey guys ! barney , i ve been looking for you"
"this is like a spring day back in minnesota , if it weren t for all the taxis and the skyscrapers and non white people"
there aren t any black people in minnesota ? not if prince is on tour
"ted has a little sister gets hotter every day and if i ever meet her with her boobies i will play ! everybody ! sister , sister , sister ! what ? i can celebrate hanukkah , too"
do you blame me ? you re like weird al yankovic if he only wrote christmas songs about banging my sister
"if only ted knew someone who worked at , say goliath national bank , then wait"
"but if it ll make you feel better , i i ll tag along to gnb tomorrow"
"why ? what are they gonna do if they find out i m from does this look like a dallas bar to you , pal ? it s weird , but there s something comforting about being carried like this"
she will hate my guts if she knows that i blabbed
"if i m ever lucky enough to have a son , and name him rashad tarkenton"
"you just , if you push it towards the not down , towards the middle"
if you want to live
"what ? we all love you , okay ? if you ever moved back to canada , we would hop on a plane , we would track you down , and after barney dragged us to a few of those strip clubs you talked about , we would bring you back right here where you re supposed to be"
what else you got ? cold war ? mrs
"if this is gonna happen on occasion , we can t tell anyone about this"
"if i m gonna pay so woman an hour to make me feel better , we aren t going to be talking"
we wouldn t even be talking about this if marshall could read a magazine at work
"so , you checked into a hotel room just so you could read a magazine there ? hey , robin , do you want me to see if the waitress has any giant sugar cubes for that high horse of yours ? nobody likes to read a magazine at work and if they say that they do , then they re not human"
"so , if i want a really crisp contrast ratio the crt s deep pixel cell structure produces a resolution you just can t match with an lcd"
i m not gonna freak out if you tell me you have feelings for her
"now , if you ll excuse me , i m gonna go sleep with other girls"
"oh , by the way , i have a bathroom here if you ever want to use it"
"if you re , uh , looking for ted , he left"
"why not ? if we see them play , we re no better than the bleach blonde bimbos who flash their boobs at a van halen concert"
"yeah , but don t those girls get to have sex with van halen after the show ? if you want to have sex with van halen , do it on your own time , ted"
"but if you guys want to meet up after your show , maybe we could exchange numbers excuse us for a minute"
"if you set a date without a number , they have to show up"
"what do we do if there s a blizzard ? either way , we ll be here"
"if i can land just one of these girls , i ll have party school bingo"
"yeah , well , if i know your wife , she s gonna get you that six pack anyway"
"if you are getting off the plane , where is marshall ? and where is your six pack ? that s the problem"
"i don t know if you guys have ever seen star wars , but it s like hoth out there"
"dude , carl s gonna kill us if we don t kick everyone out of here right now"
you know what else i miss ? our lunchtime phone call
"seriously , do you understand what s going to happen if that plow comes by ? you know what you are ? you re a love snob"
"there s lots of ways to be in a relationship , and you would know that if you ever left your little love snob country club"
if you could just put it in the car
"if you are , you re , like , an incredibly advanced model , and the human race doesn t stand a chance"
"one thing i do know is that if she s there sitting at the airport alone , i have to go get her"
"if you ever need anything , don t hesitate to ask"
"because if they knew where i was , they d shut me down"
"how are you getting letters if no one knows where you are , douche ? that s why i m organizing a happening outside the dining hall , monday at midnight"
"i ll be there , because x marks the spot ot ot ot ot if you think people liked your show , they did not ot ot ot this is weird"
robin only gets her work visa if she gets a job in her field
"i mean , you know what , i guess you could stay if you married a u"
"if i can leave you with one thought , it s this nothing and everything is possimpible"
"you know , like if something good happens , i get excited and i need to move , and i just i don t know"
"it s not funny , all right ? the doctor says if it gets any worse , i might need surgery"
"you said that if i slept with you , my son would get the part"
"listen , if you want , i could give you some tips on acting"
"look , lily , if today has taught us nothing else , it s that honesty is important when it comes to family"
"if you ever do meet someone special , don t run away from it"
"and i just wanted to say to you , if i ever seemed cold or unwelcoming , i m sorry"
it would mean a lot to me if you and i could be closer
"i want to eat your brain , but only if it s organic and grass fed"
"i almost don t want you to hear it , because seriously , for the rest of your life , nothing else will ever be as funny and you will curse yourself for agreeing to ever hear it in the first place"
it s funnier if you say it
"would it be the worst thing in the world if i gave her a call ? no , no , ted , it wouldn t be the worst thing in the world"
"why did you say in the restaurant ? did you kiss somewhere else ? like where , in a tree ? no , lily , we did not make out in a tree"
"well , it s a good thing that you came by because he has a really important meeting today , and it would be pretty embarrassing and not at all funny if he were to show up not wearing pants"
i m sure all the exploited diamond miners in sierra leone would give you a high five if they still had all their fingers
"okay , yes , it s dull and generic and we get spanked in the ratings by that korean channel that only shows kim jong il riding a horse , but guys , it would mean so much to me if just once i knew my friends were out there watching"
"what did she say ? what did you say ? how did it feel ? if you were to do it again , all over , would you maybe how did it happen ? it was the stupidest thing"
"and if it did , and i didn t look my absolute best for those greasy sluts , i d regret it forever"
you can call it a ninja star danger jock if you want
"no , ted , no ! i would never admit it ! there s nothing to admit ! then why was robin s earring on your dresser ? he was accessorizing ! marshall , i swear to god , if you don t tell me the truth right now wait ! marshall didn t do it"
"and if clarence the angel says it s true , it must be true"
"i mean , i guess if you guys feel that strongly about karen , then maybe it was for the best"
"who else ? remember that weird sci fi girl who wanted you to propose after , like , two months ? you barely even liked her , but you were still thinking about it , so listen , ted , you re great , and this is so difficult , but i think we re looking for different things"
"you fall in love with these women , even if they don t deserve you"
"what if one of those women was supposed to be the mother of my children ? if there was ever the tiniest chance of that , i swear i didn t do anything"
"so , if it weren t for you , ted and i might still be dating ? or you would have stayed together far too long , had an incredibly bitter breakup and not even remained friends , and then you and i would never have become best friends"
"maybe if you agreed upon that beforehand , yeah"
"so if you want to be my plus one , lily s a damn good cook"
"i mean , if it weren t for her , would we still be dating right now ? maybe"
"if the years go by , and we both turn , and we re still single robin scherbatsky will you be my backup wife ? a girl always dreams of hearing those words"
"if i could nail any celebrity , it would be lily"
but only if you guess all three parts correctly
"if someone questions you , distract them from the original lie with more lies"
would i seem heartless if i switched us back to canadian sex acts ? not at all
"okay , but i ll only tell you if you correctly guess the person , the act and the collection"
"wait , if they pulled the plug on the project a month ago , why have i been going in once a week to meet with the new headquarters task force ? well , obviously you couldn t come in and pitch to bilson"
"what the hell ? no ! no ! no , this is wrong ! for god s sake , you re on the task force ! is there anything else you want to tell me ? well , you know how you played third base for the gnb softball team ? yeah"
"ted , what if we told you that we found you a new project at gnb where you would be redesigning part of the th floor ? well , if that s a lie , it s an incredibly dull one"
"if that means i never get to know , so be it"
"but so help me , if you so much as step one toe out of line , you re gonna be playing duck hunt in your mama s basement so fast it s gonna make your head spin"
"in fact , if you did everything on the murtaugh list , i d call that a pretty fun weekend"
"if you did everything on that list , you would die"
and if you can t do it ? i will spend three hours listening to you talk about architecture
"hey , you guys mind if i crash on your futon tonight ? we don t have a futon"
i i got to get them in shape if they re gonna win that game tomorrow
"you don t keep s what s the point of playing if you don t keep score ? how do you know lily , what were you doing with this team before i got here ? i was coaching them"
"and if you don t know who s winning , who gets the trophy ? everyone"
"if i can finish your list before you finish mine , you have to come with me to tp laser tag and you have to buy the toilet paper"
"fine , but if i finish your list first , it s a six hour survey of early th century american architecture and you can never do anything on the murtaugh list ever again"
"this is not how we re gonna raise our kids ! and this is not how you re gonna coach this team ! at tomorrow s game , if you are anything less than a teddy bear stuffed with cotton candy and rainbows , i will silent treatment your ass into the ground ! you ll think the time i found your internet search history was a freakin picnic ! are we clear ? ! lily , there are many different philo are we clear ? ! yes , ma am"
"i don t know if it was marshall s tough attitude , lily s gentle encouragement , or some magical combination of the two , but in the second half of that game , that ragtag group of little firecrackers got beat down even worse"
i understand if you don t want it
your way is totally stupid stinson ! son you have been a pain in my ass but damn it if this ain t some of the finest tp work i ve ever seen
do you need anything else ? i wouldn t say no to a cup of coffee
"if ted says that pj is important to the company , then pj is not going anywhere"
what else you got ? i thought of a few others wacky tie guy
"you re breaking up with me ? if that s what you want , i totally understand"
"if lily were here , she d know exactly how to get rid of him"
"you can t trade manny ramirez for two middle relievers ! if you veto that trade , i am out of the league ! i ll figure it out"
you okay ? what if i don t think of the books ? excuse me ? there s this famous architecture story about an architect who designed this library
"what if i don t think of the books ? first of all , nobody goes to libraries anymore , so who cares about that guy ? secondly , you need to get on the phone and start calling clients"
"if he have only waited one day , people wouldn t have even heard that he died"
"well , if ted won t say it , i will"
"two if anyone were to have gay dreams about one of us , it would be me"
"if there is one thing we know about ted , it s that he likes a nice body"
"we can even get married if you want , but i still want to see other girls , it would ve to be one of those kind god , stop it"
"if i tell you , it ll just ruin it"
"so , you see , kids , if i had gone to schlegel s bagels as usual , i would have taken a right"
"petra here , if all goes well , will be my wait for it , two hundredth"
not if i was wearing a hazmat suit
"now , if he s bedded of them , that is a success rate of a little over one percent"
"i was thinking about you and me and if you re still interested okay , blondie , time for mama s cardio ! geez ! mommy ! every inch of her tasted like roast beef and creatine"
"who cares if pauline doesn t pose for bikini pictures in magazines ? actually , she does"
"if i hadn t done that , i would ve walked right by the newsstand , cut down th and gotten to that corner a minute early"
"back when marshall first started working at goliath national bank fran , i don t mean to bother you but i have a big presentation tomorrow and it would really help if i could get like some charts and graphs made up"
"i need my charts , jack ! my god , you re doing charts at work ? they re for work , you idiot ! i m giving a big presentation right now and if i don t have those charts i m gonna get fired ! crap"
"and so , if i hadn t bought those charts back for marshall , i wouldn t have had to cut down th to give milt his daily dollar and well , you know the rest"
"if i had known then where all those little things were leading me , and how grateful i d be to get there , well , i probably would ve done something like this"
"what a nice surprise ? no , a nice surprise would be if a safe fell from stories and smushed them both"
"a check so big , if you had sex with it , you wouldn t tell your buddies"
"i would ve done that , too , if i d have been going to a barbecue"
"if i can talk a stripper into paying me for a lap dance , i think i can talk my way out of a ticket"
job s yours if you want it
"i m gonna go to my laundry room , and you tell me if you can hear me"
"i don t know what else to do , okay ? i love him"
"if anything , this is pimped in"
"cause if i can make this jump tonight , it s totally gonna save the party"
"so , you re the guy who tried to make it with a goat ? if anything , that goat tried to make it with me"
and damn it if it wasn t the best year of my life
"because , if any one of those things hadn t happened , i never would have ended up and turned out to be the best job i ever had"
"this is our first double date ! first of millions ! what if our kids get married ? oh , i love this ! yeah"
"there s such a thing as common sense , you know ? hey , you can whip me if you want"
"well and if you re a professor , where s your hat and your whip ? they re at home"
"mistake number three , dude , where was the hat ? because if you re not going to wear it , i m taking it back"
"if people don t know their place , nobody s happy"
"announcer ladies and gentlemen , time to pucker up for the new york rangers kiss cam ! crowd kiss ! kiss ! kiss ! kiss ! kiss ! kiss ! kiss ! kiss ! kiss ! kiss ! kiss ! kiss ! okay , how about this ? if you kiss me and you feel bad about it , you re meant to be with barney"
"sit down , define the relationship , write down that definition on a piece of paper , slip it under the door and if i like what i read , you can go"
"of course , if i had taken that girl s question , who , by the way , was not your mom"
"not good enough ! so if any of you have even the slightest inclination to do anything with your life other than become an architect , you re wasting my time and yours"
"if we re gonna do it again , i m gonna need some gatorade no"
"and if the alternative is not being together , then it s worth taking this risk cause she s awesome"
"so , if robin knew that you were here , she would be completely fine with it ? are you kidding ? she d sprint down here with a purse full of singles and a poncho for the jell o show"
"and after an appropriate number of years , you should find someone else , someone like that busty delivery girl from that one time , and plow her like a cornfield"
"cause if you didn t , that would be mighty shellfish"
"correct me if i m wrong , but i don t remember that date going that well"
you know what we should do ? we should retrace the rest of that night and figure out what else we do wrong on first dates
"and they are my best friends , so don t be surprised if they suddenly can t think of anything i do wrong"
"and seven years ago , if you think about it , we didn t miss by that much"
"i mean , if a couple of things had gone a little bit differently , who knows what would have happened ? rewind playing singing asking you to stay the words are finally here let s rewind and rewind you see , you re the only star in the film i never made would you rewind it all the time rewind it all the time wow"
"so , if you need me , i ll be getting grinded like some pepper in the champagne room"
"ted laughs shouldn t we hold out for the person who doesn t just tolerate our little quirks , but actually kind of likes them ? even if it means finding ourselves on another blind date with each other seven years from now ? oh , dear god , i hope that doesn t happen"
"well , anything sounds weird if you say it times"
"if you don t want to lose her , you gotta try a little harder"
what ? why else would he buy me flowers ? he s getting some on the side
"so , if you give me a few weeks of attention , i could give you a lifetime of happiness"
"if you ever see robin looking like this , get some food in her quick , or one of two things will happen"
"if you ever , ever see this face , barney , run"
"for shame ! i bet you couldn t even grow a mustache if you wanted to ! neither can you , sweetie"
"if she tells you you re an idiot , you are a lucky man"
"and if she does say , i love you , she s already broken up with you in her mind"
"correct ! and if she achieves that , will she truly be happy ? no ! robin s deep seated need for attention can be traced back to her father s emotional distance , and no amount of success will ever make up for what she truly needs , which is six simple words from her dad , robin , i m proud of you , eh ? yes ! both panting but i guess you re right"
"if we can t figure out how to be with each other in a real , honest way , i don t see the point of even trying"
"marshall hey , guys ! if you don t want the barrel , can you sit somewhere else ? cause you re scaring away potential takers"
i wonder if harold s still in jail
"no , wait , if you leave now , colonel mustard just gets away with it"
"and if anything didn t go according to plan , they would freak out"
"if last night went so horribly , why do lily and marshall think it was such a hit ? i mean , we knew we were gonna have fun tonight , but we had no idea how much"
"if this was last year , why are you acting like it was oliver twist ? ted , it s a poem"
"but if that s true , that s awesome"
"if i recall , they didn t dump us until you brought up that vermont trip"
"no ! what s gazzola s ? a filthy mecca of spectacular if undercooked pizza located at kinzie street , chicago , illinois"
"we were like lewis and clark , if lewis and clark peed in empty soda bottles and had a bong made out of a cantaloupe"
"but , robin , if you want to live here , work here , and throw chairs at people here , you have to do this"
"you invited lily ? we most certainly did ! i don t know if you caught that , but he did the we thing"
"how am i supposed to have fun ? both singing along and i would walk miles and i would walk more hey , you really think lily s pissed ? if she s pissed , she s pissed"
making me wonder if this pizza is worth the hour drive
"well , if you re so worried , why don t you give her a call ? i have"
"number two , and this is the biggie , quit letting awesome chicks like robin scherbatsky get away because , guess what ? you don t want her ? i m planting my flag in her , if you know what i mean , which you probably don t , and getting her the hell out of here"
"older ted and if she didn t mean it then , she certainly meant it minutes later"
do you mind if there is a sink full of dirty dishes ? not really
"yeah , but if i said that to her , it would only lead to a fight , so oh ! you fight"
"every time it looks like we re about to get into a fight why is there a bag of panties labeled april in your closet ? so any time you think you might have a fight , you just get up and leave ? can t fight if you re not there"
"why waste it on talking ? but if you insist , here s what i would say about the dishes , if i were lily s husband"
"lily , i know you don t like a dirty sink , but does that make it my job to keep it clean ? i mean , if one day i look up at the living room ceiling and think , hey , i d like a replica of the sistine chapel up there"
"exactly ! so , baby , by the same logic , if you don t like looking at a sink full of dishes , shouldn t it be your job to clean them ? wow"
"i think that if i explain it to her , she ll get it and i ll get my way"
i ll wash my dish if you get up there and just you paint naked babies on the ceiling
"lily if you need to go in the middle of the night , either turn the bathroom light on or sit down"
"and if i want to leave my manhood dirty in the sink , caked with ketchup and pasta what are you eating ? then damn it , that s my right ! i ll wash my manhood when i m good and ready ! where was he not sitting ? hmm"
i don t care if the dishes aren t done
"okay , if you care , you do it"
then i don t care if you have an orgasm
"if you care , you do it"
"but if it s something cheese based , like a nice ziti , at least soak it , okay ? of course , baby"
"hey , so what if we re not the best couple in the world ? totally"
"if you re watching this tape , and i knew you d pick this one , then you are now in possession of my porn"
"if i m dead , i want you to honor my memory by taking my body to the hamptons and recreating weekend at bernie s"
"so , please , if you value my best friendship that s right , marshall , i m his best friend"
"if they re not happy , why don t they just break up ? because they re too stubborn"
"what is this doing in my champagne ? if we make robin think for even a second that barney is proposing , she ll lose it , and they ll break up"
i don t know if it s gonna fit in here
"if we try anything now , they re gonna know it s us"
so what if they saw us ? lt ll still work
"i mean , if this doesn t work , what will ? we re so similar"
"one more for the road ? and , i mean , who knows , maybe when , like , you turn , if you haven t found anyone i already have that deal with ted"
"well , maybe when you turn , if you haven t found anyone robin laughing older ted it turns out that they really did just need to let things run their course"
imagine what would happen if anybody ever got their hands on that ? ooh ! you
there s no way i d be single right now if i wanted to be single
the only way she would be upset is if someone told her it was all a bunch of lies
"look , if these girls are dumb enough to fall for this crap , they have it coming"
"if you fall for that one , my heart breaks for you , but i m sorry , you re a smoron"
"now , if you don t mind , i am off to prepare for tonight s main event"
"if you go out there , looking for a paper , you re coming back with frozen waffles , and in this case , frozen waffles is a guy"
"oh , my god , that s horrible ! wonder if that would work"
have you guys seen the my penis grants wishes ? really ? a genie comes out of it ? only if you rub it hard enough

"lily if we play the next seconds right , ted will dye his hair blond"
"if anyone s looking for the real slim shady , he s right here"
"mmm hmm ? not for nothing or nothing , but we d still be doing this even if we hadn t seen doppelganger barney , right ? oh , but we did see him , which means the universe , in all its infinite wisdom , is telling you to stick me and stick me real good"
"baby , you knew i needed to decide if we lily , we need to be in control of our own destinies"
maybe it wouldn t be the worst thing if a baby joined our little group
"and if you let your guard down for so much as a second , as sure as you were born , i will hump your brains out"

"if you can find a number in there that i don t call regularly , i ll gladly delete it"
"but you keep it in your phone because it reminds you of a version of yourself that you could be , even if it s a version of yourself that you ll never become"
"if you can find a number that i don t need or shouldn t have in here , be my guest , but good luck"
"but if i have to , you have to"
"it s so obvious , right ? as if that s going to make me be like , oh , god , i never should have said no"

"if you want to talk , i m right here"
if you can t spot the crazy person on the bus it s you
"if you left , i d have to follow you"
i can t do this if it means tearing down the arcadian
"it would be sweeter if you hadn t thought i was a tranny before , but it s still sweet"
and marshall never would ve listened to the indigo girls if it weren t for lily
"if i thought that lily talked in that much detail about our sex life , i d probably kill myself"
"maybe not in the way you were picturing , but i stayed up all night working on a new concept , all right ? what if my design could incorporate the arcadian s facade into the new gnb headquarters ? narrator kids , it was one of those moments in life where everything comes together the girl , the building , everything , until are you married ? yeah"

"i have no idea how to raise a daughter ! what if she makes bad choices ? i mean , what if she winds up dating some oh , god"

loving the dirty talk but you know what s even hotter ? if we face this a way
"okay , well , if you really think this is going to help your image"

"no , if i wanted to make it personal , i d call you a bored little trophy wife who likes to play activist when the shops on th avenue are closed"
"what would college you say if he heard what you were saying right now ? honestly ? probably something pretentious , and pseudo intellectual , like boogers"
"you want to know why i want to save that building ? because when i look up at the arcadian , i see something big and solid , and right now everything else in my life just feels like i m on a boat"
"if you stand in the right spot , you can hear an entire conversation all the way across the room"
"look , lily , i know that you would have been okay if we were poor and i was trying to save the world , but will you still be okay if i make a lot of money and i spend all of it spoiling you and our kids ? we ll make it work"
"barney , you know what ? if you re going to be disgusting , we re not watching this , okay ? yeah"

"if there s one thing you never do , it s call a woman fat right to her face ! i m sorry , lily"
"if i wanted to kill you , i d invite you to my hunting lodge"
"i was just feeling guilty that i lied to the captain and i don t know , i just thought it would be good if you two spent some time together"
"i mean , if either one of us had even the slightest hint of feelings for the other , we shouldn t hang out"

"why do you even like me ? come her i am constantly amazed by the things you say , entranced by the things you do , and unlike a certain jalapea o coconut vodka martini , you re easy on the eye and if we re together long enough , i hope that one day you see yourself the way i see you"

"if you ask me , vinnie s a real jerk"
"marshall you know what , robin ? if it s meant to be , then it won t matter"
"who are you ? chuckles if we analyze the seemingly random patterns of the train , taking into account standard deviation , and assuming that epsilon approaches zero as angle delta approaches pi , we can conclude snoring damn it , ted ! i was about to drop some sweet word play about logarithms and getting into a rhythm with my log"
"so if you feel something for quinn , go for it"

"if you ll excuse me , i ve got some sonnets to write"
"i mean , yes , it s five years later , and you haven t settled down with anyone else , but you haven t settled down with robin , either"
"what s standing in the way ? frustrated muttering god if you help me find this sex tape , i am going to make some changes in my life"
"so if robin started dating someone else , you wouldn t mind ? nope"
even if that somebody else was me ? even if that somebody else was you
"and if , uh , you make her happy , then that makes me happy"
"we we we still have our deal , right ? if we re both still single when we re ? yeah"
"as long as the door is even a little bit open , i have this feeling that i ll just be waiting around to see if i win the lottery when you turn"

"what if i pay for a dance ? that way , your manager s happy , and then i can to tell you why you should go on another date with me"

"if she were playing me , why would she agree to go on a date with me ? you re different than the rest of these schlubs"
"ugh ! hey ! brainstorm ! what if we just have our date here , it s a date"
"it s not a date , if you go into a strip club and paying for lap dances"
"if it s not a date , why d she say , every fifth day was free ? because that s the lusty leopard s policy on friday nights , and i m so mad at you that i know that ! robin dear diary"
"ugh ! hey ! brainstorm ! what if we just have our date here , maybe in the champagne room ? that was our spot"
"hey , gorgeous , you want a dance ? is it a jig ? cause if so , it s up"
"okay , but if you two are so unhappy , why don t you just move back to manhattan ? because the suburbs are better for the baby"
"who says ? who says any place is better for the baby if you two are unhappy in it ? no , no , we live here now"
"and , you know , this place wouldn t seem so bad if we got one of our friends to move out here"
"look , i am sorry if i hurt your feelings it s a job"

"i ll keep saying stuff like is it okay if i put out the hummus , bunny face ? quinn and i ll be the bossy bitch who says no , save it for dessert , idiot"
"are you kidding ? who am i to judge anyone ? i m the devil ! i mean , if you ever wanted to stop stripping , i d support it"

"i m just saying , if you ever wanted to hang up the ol g string , i d completely understand"
"hypothetically , what would make you stop ? hypothetically i would stop stripping if i ever got married"

"if it still hasn t happened for me by then , laughing something is seriously wrong with me ! laughter continues something is seriously wrong with me"
"barney wait wait wait a minute ! who is melanie ? come on , barney , if there s one thing i can count on not to change , it s you walking in with some random girl on your arm"
i wonder if things ll be a lot different when we watch the trilogy again in
"but then it hit me for the first time in my adult life , i didn t have a roommate ! if i want to walk around naked , nobody cares"
"if i want to leave the laundry basket in the middle of the living room , nobody stops me"
"if i bring home soup from the deli and leave it in the fridge for two days , nobody eats it"
"and if i do something colossally stupid , nobody ever has to know"
"but if i could just present a counter argument you re locked out , dummy ! damn it ! barney ! give me your phone i m calling my super"
"if all nights are legendary , no nights are legendary"

"if you re just joining us , the world wide news eye in the sky traffic chopper is out of control over manhattan and being piloted by our own robin scherbatsky"
"if i don t do something to take my mind off of it you re lucky that you can just go sit around the house , ted"
"ah , i m really sorry , i i just think it s best if robin and i don t see each other for a while"
"and if you can t do the same , well , then shame on you"
"but if they had any idea how difficult it is the jealousy , the insecurity , those high fives would be high fives of condolence"
"now , if you ll excuse me , i have a practice baby to soothe"
"if anyone knows what that feels like , it s me"
"well , what do you want me to do , robin ? i have to get over you somehow , and if this is what it takes are you okay ? yeah"
"barney , if i took this job , you would own me"

"two scotches , both neat , and if you ve got some , uh , nuts , this guy lost a couple"
"then what s holding us back ? call in the mosby boys , ted , let me know if they crack the case"
"if brover meets a cutie , i ll take the hit and chat up the chubby lady friend"

"if you do dump him , at least let him down easy"
"okay , um i don t know if we should keep seeing each other"
"sniffles exhales heavily anyway , what were you going to say ? uh i was gonna say , order whatever else you want"
"robin , if you dump nick , he could get mad and tear your blouse off"
"what ? ! it goes out automatically unless i stop it , and that only happens if i hear you dump nick on speakerphone before then"
"if it s a small tear , he can still make playoffs"
"sighs nick , you are so sweet , but i just good news is it doesn t really matter if it takes my groin pull a little longer to heal , so i may as well start having sex again"

"and if robin could mean happiness for you then , dear god , why help her go after another man ? because she might still be in love with him"
"i , ted mosby promise to stop putting everyone else s interests ahead of my own and for once in my life do what s best for me"

"i just think we have to accept our lots in life , and i have to be a mom to a a beautiful , wonderful if slightly constipated little boy , and you have to let robin and barney get a band"
i did not tell him but if that s the price for my daughter s love then i will gladly let carol pay it
because if barney and robin had taken my stupid advice and hired a dj i never would have met your mother
"others groan narrator so what if my friends thought it was doomed ? i was still young , and i knew that a night of partying with a girl over a decade younger than me would be a total disaster"

"but if lily wasn t into you ? lily , how you thrill me but it might just even kill me if you do not say i will y to this question will you go out with me ? dahmer"

"snorts the only way that s happening is if i get to hook up with someone , too"
"if it is a booty call , then robin will just let him down easy , but in the meantime , ted is back on the captain s good side"
"if you like art , you should see the painting i just acquired"
"if you ve got something to say , say it"
"truth is , i m in love with somebody else now"
"what if he asks you out ? what does that mean for our relationship ? what , are we planning to be in some super enlightened , forward thinking marriage , where we don t get hung up on the suffocating and outdated principles of monogamy , and instead enjoy the company of multiple partners , sometimes bringing said partners into our marital bed , but just girls , not dudes , except maybe one time just to see what that s like ? i mean , is that what you want ? no"
"lily , if you tell me that you slept with the captain for anything under"
"captain ? we ll talk tomorrow ? if you like art , you should see the painting i just acquired"
"so , who wants to see that painting ? ooh , if you show me yours , i ll show you mine"
"well , if i have a passion , it s taking life and turning it into a series of crazy stories"
"if you can do that without me , then i don t even know who i am anymore"
"wait , if you weren t calling about the ashtray , then why d you want to see me ? follow me"
"wait , are you offering me a job ? if you want it"
and i d burn it again if i could
"why didn t you just mail it like everybody else ? oh , see , that s sad , robin"
"so you re bringing a plus one ? if you count the voices in her head , it s plus five"
"no , marshall , if lily s gonna make it in this fancy art world , you re gonna have to make it , too , so suck it up , stop sitting on the art , and bust out the a material"
"if you ll indulge me , i would like to share a story about my dearly departed grandmother"
"i don t know if you heard , but i dropped some skittles"
"if we re gonna be in a marriage and trust each other , you can t lie to me ever"
"you don t mind if i spend the night , do you ? um , how else are we gonna get to know each other on a deeper level ? excuse me , i just have to log tonight s orgasms with the licensing board"
"and if that will make you happy , then let s do it"
"and if you re not too tired , maybe we could watch woodworthy manor tonight"
"barney , i wouldn t live here even if you scrubbed every inch of this place with purell , amoxicillin and holy water"
"if i ever figure a way out of here , i will make your life a living lily and i really need this night out"
"if you get there before come on , really ? i ll see you later"
"if we weren t about to have an orgy , i d be so mad at you right now"
"if you ll follow me into the bedroom , i ll show you some beautiful woodwork"
"i don t want to tell you and emsbry how to raise your child , but i think if you keep letting him nap , he s gonna be up all night"
"well , aren t you ducky ? seriously if you were straight , i d be all over you"
"robin gasps if you never get a black light , you ll be so happy here"
"if i get blinded in one eye by a badminton shuttlecock , you might as well call me lord esterbrooke"
"if i ask you to change too many things about yourself , you re not gonna be the man i fell in love with"
"barney , i swear to god , if i open my eyes and your bare ass is an inch away from my face again just open your eyes"
come on ! if you don t believe that robots vs
"trust me , you will regret it if you don t"
"if ted doesn t get wasted , there s no way he ll end up making out with that surprisingly realistic looking female robot"
"immaterial ! if it s gonna be named after anybody , it should be called the marshall eriksen"
i will name every drink in this bar after you if you can tell me my last name
"right , because if you go over there and you talk to her , end in one of two ways"
none of this would have happened if lily had let me dance
"what , you re not gonna try and stop me ? and how would i try and stop you ? i don t know , by telling me life is short , and if you ever come across a beautiful , exciting , crazy moment in it , you got to seize it while you can before that moment s gone ? ted , this moment already is gone"
"narrator kids , it s been almost years since that cold april night in , and i can safely tell you , if i could go back in time and relive that night , there s no way in hell i d go to robots vs"
"i don t know if you can picture me holding your six foot seven cousin marvin over my head , but back then i could"
"look , and if i can t have them , i ll take the seconds before your boyfriend shows up and punches me in the face , because i love you"
all whoa oh oh oh for the longest for the longest time whoa oh oh for the longest for the longest time if you said good bye to me tonight ooh ooh ooh there would still be music left to write doo doo doo what else could i do ? i m so inspired by you that hasn t happened for the longest time
"what ? ! that that that s amazing , but i i don t know if i can just uproot my life"
"what is going on ? bernard , if we just glue the cards together lily ! what are you doing here ? well , i baked you brownies because i thought you were busy working , but so when you said lily , hey , i can t really talk"
"if we start now , we can be done by lunch"
"if we lived in italy , i could just spend my days taking care of marvin and trying to make pasta and watching italian price is right"
"so if there s anything you want me to remove , just tell me to remove it and it s gone"
"well , hey , i mean , maybe after this , if you re not doing anything"
"if liddy came back to the table and you said uh , liddy , why don t you , uh , take off that coat ? you want me to take my coat off ? how about instead , i take off your face ? ow ! ow , oh ! really ? you had to have her beat me up ? she s not done , ted"
i did it ! i proved to myself and everyone else that i have no desire to be with any other woman
"lily , what s the real reason ? what if we moved to rome what s so funny ? i m uh sorry"
"i m just saying , if i was getting married in three weeks but you re not getting married in three weeks , ted"
"okay , lily , if i can move from st"
can you say anything else ? that that was the same sentence
"so , no offense , but if you two plan it , it s gonna be ordi why wait for it ? nary"
"if this is anything like my bachelor party strippers , booze , definitely no hand stuff wink wink it is gonna be in wait for it credible"
"oh , ralph , if you want , i can lily"
"so when she asked if i d help , well , my answer just had to be hai ! william zabka !"
"until then , if you abide by my rulings , i will tell you what goes to italy and what goes in the triangle"
"the biggest rule for de cluttering is , have you used it in the last year ? if not triangle"
"so i m whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa are you suggesting that i will not be point guy ? look , if michael jordan s healthy , you don t let scottie pippen run the offense"
"if how do i put this ? if wayne gretzky s healthy , you don t let uh frana ois what i m saying is hockey is stupid and i m point guy"
"i mean , if you haven t used it in the last year oh ! using it ! italy ! triangle ! italy"
"what s that got to do with laser tag ? everything ! and we will prevail , even if it takes all night ! tanner"
anyone else have any scheduling issues ? you can take down anyone on their team but i want the big man for myself
"so long , losers ! um look , can you guys help me down ? i um ted , if this chair really means that much to you , why don t you just take it for yourself ? no , it s important that you keep it"
"what if our friendship doesn t pass the have you used it in a year test ? if you can throw out this chair who s to say you can t throw me out , too ? that could never happen"
"if it comes down to it , i need a volunteer to let the rest of us eat him"
"if you told barney that you needed him , he d be here in a heartbeat"
but i still don t know if he s ready for this
i still don t know if i am
"but if i could find this locket if it was still here , waiting for me that would mean that the universe wanted me to marry barney"
"or we could keep playing , if you want"
"if you re moving to rome , i at least need to see my grandson before you go ! of course , and that is why we would love for you to come visit us for a week"
"okay , mom , here s the plan um , lily has to work , so marvin and i will come visit you for a whole week , and i i ll see if i can get a last minute flight"
"and you , if you let judy talk you out of going to italy , so help me , i will never let you stuff my ravioli again"
"but real quick if you let judy come to rome with us , you are going to have to find someone else to do your laundry and massage your feet"
"well , what if i ? no"
i just i just think it would be best for everyone if i wasn t around for it
"even now , after all these years , there s still just this part of me where , if there s even the slightest chance something i do could make robin smile , i don t even think about it i just do it"
"i mean , if i could make that locket magically appear , i would"
"i would open a vein in my arm if i could bleed that locket out , just to make her happy"
could be there s nothing else you want me to grab your bag ? yeah
if i got this aren t you gonna check that ? no
"why are we exiting again ? well , if you turn in your binder to the section labeled mennonite windmills get back on the expressway now"
"why did you post that judge photo ? because i m guilty of being one proud mama ! lily doesn t know that i took the job , so if she sees it , i m dead"
you know what ? i don t care if these are poisoned
"okay , look , if it s true , if we are you know"
"and even if we did , king joffrey s parents were brother and sister , and he was a fair and wise leader"

"we re gonna have a nice dinner , some drinks , and then , according to robin , if her aunt edith gets drunk enough , she ll take off her wig and they ll play hockey with it"
if he really exists
"setting aside the fact that i ve kept your whole moving to chicago thing a secret , aren t you supposed to be dressed like liberace right now ? okay , first of all , if i showed up in costume , it would steal from the surprise and spectacle of my grand entrance"
"so , marshall can t go to italy ? not if he wants to be a judge"
"can we please get to the surprise laser tag rehearsal ? hey , there is no surprise laser tag rehearsal dinner ! okay , but if i may offer an opposing view"

"if you re really nervous , don t think of it as a slap"
slap the tree ? if you can
"it s a poignant parable whose message , is if you love someone , set them free"

"and , well no ! stop it ! just stop ! you did not slap the heart out of a man s body ! if only that were true"

"if i have to hold the shotgun myself , it s happening"
"but setting aside the fact that all of our friends are here and that we don t speak italian , if we stay in new york , we both get to follow our dreams"
"if you keep lying to me , if you keep cutting me out of decisions , if you keep using words like winning and losing when you talk about our marriage"
"it s not like it ll happen all at once , but if you keep acting this way , little by little , you re gonna lose me"
"i m in love with her , okay ? if you re looking for the word that means caring about someone beyond all rationality and wanting them to have everything they want , no matter how much it destroys you , it s love ! and when you love someone , you just , you you don t stop , ever"
"especially then ! you just you don t give up ! because if i could give up if i could just , you know , take the whole world s advice and and move on and find someone else , that wouldn t be love"

"if it helps , i m pretty sure barney stinson s a fake name"
"and if you think i would ever be part of screwing that up , then maybe you don t know me at all , robin"
"love is totally nonsensical , but we have to keep doing it or else we re lost and and love is dead and humanity should just pack it in"
"chuckles i vow to always sit next to you and hug you , even if you re covered in vomit , whether it s yours or marvin s or in the case of what came to be known as spew year s eve my own"

ask me if the abominable snowman called
"clears throat if you don t get married in that time , you have to re propose"
"so if everything goes well , in a couple of months , you won t be calling me judge fudge anymore"
"but i m glad it was long and difficult , because if i hadn t gone through hell to get there , the lesson might not have been as clear"
"even then , in what can only be called the worst of times , all i could do was thank god , thank every god there is , or ever was , or will be , and the whole universe , and anyone else i can possibly thank will i see you tonight ? that i saw that beautiful girl on that train platform , and that i had the guts to stand up , walk over to her , tap her on the shoulder , open my mouth , and speak"

"i don t know how else to say this , but i m in love"
sorry if me doing my job interferes with your club
wejust have to see if you can dance in it
"uh , so , should we see if you can dance in it ? okay"
you can sing along if you want to
probably would have went over better if you didn t announce it in the showers
it s just that if i don t do it the guys on the team are gonna kick the crap out of me
they re the ones you look back at when you get old and think what if ? i don t buy that
"and if it is one minute late , i will go to the animal shelter and get you a kitty cat"
you know why they call them slushees ? because your butt looks like one if you have too many of them
"that s okay if that happens , quinn , because there are of your friends right here who are gonna be more than happy to help clean you off"
so if i have a pregnant girl doing a handspring into a double layout the judges aren t going to be admiring her impeccable form

"schue , if i may ? we all know i m more popular than rachel"

if we were gonna rank crush worthy teachers at this school you d be number one with a bullet
"and if i don t get enough sleep , my antidepressants won t work"
"if you re feeling awkward telling rachel how you feel then why don t you , um , you know , sing it to her"
what if she tells my mom ? she s not
who else you wanna tell ? she s not gonna tell anybody
she asked if she could see your baby pictures
"baby , if it s that bad , you have to let me see it"
"well , why not , huh , if it s win win for everyone ? look , she s a really good cook"
"if she wanted to do something , she would have when she found out that i was pregnant"
and you were so scared of what he would do if he found out that you just pushed it aside like we do every bad feeling in this house
"if you don t talk about it , it doesn t exist"
"if you continue to stalk me , i ll press charges"
"sometimes in our lives we all have pain we all have sorrow but if we are wise we know that there s always tomorrow lean on me when you re not strong and i ll be your friend i ll help you carry on for it won t be long till i m gonna need somebody to lean on just lean on me call on me , brother hey when you need a hand when you need a hand we all need somebody t o lean on somebody to lean on i just might have a problem that you ll understand we all need somebody t o lean on oh , whoa , whoa if if t here is a load t here s a load y ou have to bear y ou have to bear that you can t carry i i am a m right up the road i ll share your load if you just call me call me oh , call me call me when you need a friend call me call me call me w hen you need a friend call me call me any time of day call me it won t be long till i m gonna need somebody to lean on lean on , lean on me lean on me lean , lean on me lean on me lean on me y ou can lean on me i m gonna need somebody somebody to lean on somebody hey , hey t o lean on somebody to lean on y eah w hoa , ho ho"
i don t care if that baby comes out with a mohawk
if the other glee clubs get set lists and videos they ll know exactly how to beat us at sectionals
all right ? and if you can t take muhammad to the mountain then you got to get muhammad to bring the mountain down to his house
"if something s going on , you ll know"
"schue , if i may what they were doing was just all smoke and mirrors"
"schue , if we re gonna do a song about hair , shouldn t we have more hair ? i m one step ahead of you"
"i mean , we have to pull out all the stops if we wanna win"
finn would freak if i started spending time with puck though
"if you wanted intimacy , you you would ask me how i m feeling about being pregnant"
maybe if your look was better more desirable finn would be in your arms right now
how can you bring her here ? what if he saw her ? you re gonna wanna hear this
"do you think i m rollin around in deaf choir money ? sure , my kids may be deaf , but that shouldn t distract everyone from the fact that they still have a song in their heart and they should have the same chance as everyone else to express it"
all i am saying is that it would be nice if you went and hosted another scrimmage and had the courtesy to invite us this time
i would get something like that for phil if i didn t think it would make him so happy
i wanted to know if you wanted to come over on friday night
"i , uh , wanted to ask your permission to maybe do something on friday night if you re oh , that s fine"
"and if there s anything on that list that involves demeaning , fruity hair tossing , i m cutting it ! i will not let you dictate my number choices"
"you think i m living in a fairy tale ? if i were second , or if i were th , i d still be ahead of you , because i m a girl"
"imagine there s no heaven it s easy if you try no hell below us above us only sky imagine all the people living life for today imagine there s no countries imagine there s no countries it s not hard to do it isn t hard to do nothing to kill or die for nothing to kill or to die for and no religion too imagine all the people living life in peace you you may say i m a dreamer but i m not the only one i hope someday you will join us and the world will be as one imagine no possessions i wonder if you can no need for greed or hunger abrotherhood of man imagine all the people sharing all the world you you may say i m a dreamer but i m not the only one i hope someday y ou will join us y ou ll join us and the world will live as one hey , babe"
so you expect to raise a baby with me and text dirty messages to every other girl at this school if i don t give it up to you every day ? no
are you serious ? a girl really needs a good father and the only way she s gonna get that is if i give her to you
"you with the sad eyes don t be discouraged oh , i realize it s hard to take courage in a world full of people you can lose sight of it all and darkness still inside you will make you feel so small but i see your true colors shining through i see your true colors and that s why i love you so don t be afraid to let them show your true colors true colors are beautiful like a rainbow show me a smile then don t be unhappy can t remember when i last saw you laughing if this world makes you crazy and you ve taken all you can bear you call me up because you know i ll be there and i see your true colors shining through shining , yeah i see your true colors and that s why i love you so don t be afraid a fraid to let them show your true colors true colors true colors are beautiful like a rainbow"
if we were gonna rank crush worthy teachers at this school you d be number one with a bullet
mind if i join you ? hmm
but if we no
"you know , sometimes things sound a lot different coming from a peer even if that peer is as annoying as rachel"
none of this is gonna matter if they win at sectionals
but if you lean over it ll look like you have stomach rolls
"face it , we wouldn t have all of the cheerleaders and football players in the club if it wasn t for you"
"if things don t change , we re not even gonna place at sectionals and then the club is over"
"if i took the glee club photo , they d make me choose between a hitler mustache or buck teeth"
kendra stole it for me so i can see if any of her old clothes would fit pick up your shirt
"friday after christmas , which i have off if you re hideous , stay at home"
you wouldn t know if your glee club was using your office to breed rabbits for pets or for food
"what are you even talking about ? look look , the kids did the commercial to foster a feeling of unity after you not anyone else you got them banned from the yearbook"
"and what if i were to just innocently murder you , will ? i d still have to go to trial"
it seems to me that if figgins found out you would get banned from competition
now get out of my office if you can manage to squeeze through the door without your water breaking all over my new carpet
if i hadn t slept on that mattress we could have just returned them and moved on
but then when i thought about it some more i thought about what i would have done if i d felt you slipping away
but if if you can t win without me there then i haven t done my job
smile though your heart is aching smile even though it s breaking when there are clouds in the sky you ll get by if you smile through your pain and sorrow smile and maybe tomorrow you ll see the sun come shining through for you light up your face with gladness hide every trace of sadness although a tear may be ever so near that s the time you must keep on trying smile what s the use of crying you ll find that life is still worthwhile if you just smile smile though your heart is aching smile even though it s breaking when there are clouds in the sky you ll get by that s the time y ou must keep on trying on trying smile what s the use of crying you ll find that life is still worthwhile if you just smile you ll find that life is still worthwhile if you just smile smile
"if she finds out , she s gonna tell finn"
"if it were , santana and i would be dating"
"if she tells finn , he s going to flip"
"if one of the parents is a carrier , there s a chance that the child has it"
they would only run the test if one of the parents was jewish
why ? is that even a real thing ? if something is wrong with the baby terri schuester isn t gonna take it
i fully understand if you want to beat me up
"if you can , just try and avoid my nose"
"if we re first , then everyone has to measure up to us"
"and if we re last , then we re the freshest in the judges minds"
"no , you know what the real shame is ? it s that maybe if you believed in them just a little bit more they would have been amazing up there without cheating"
"believe what you want but no one s forcing me to be here and if you ever tell anyone this , i ll deny it but i like being in glee club"
"mercedes , do you have anything else in your repertoire ? yeah , but it s not as good as anything you re gonna sing"
"if anyone s gonna go belt it on the fly , it should be her"

"well , you ve clearly made up your mind not to be impartial in this case so let s see if you can t wrap up this little lecture , slap me on the wrist and let me get back to whipping my squad of champions into shape"
"okay , if this is the way you wanna play it"

"i know i saved glee club , and i guess chicks dig me but i guess if i m being honest , it s more like i m not over her"
"if you re back , let s bury the hatchet"
you know what else i m gonna bring ? i m gonna bring some asian cookery to rub your head with
only this time i could just lean over and kiss you if i want to
if you were samurai and my letter opener were sharp enough i would ask you both right now to commit seppuku
"if you want the job and back in my good graces , you re gonna have to turn around and listen up"
britt and i were wondering if you wanted to go out
"and that s where you lose , finn because if you take a second look at me you d realize that i m the only person in your life who knows you and accepts you for who you are , no matter what"
"i wake up every evening with a big smile on my face and it never feels out of place when you see my face hope it gives you hell hope it gives you hell now , where s your picket fence , love and where s that shiny car and did it ever get you far you never seemed so tense , love i ve never seen you fall so hard do you know where you are and truth be told i miss you and truth be told i m lying when you see my face hope it gives you hell hope it gives you hell when you walk my way hope it gives you hell hope it gives you hell if you find a man that s worth a damn and treats you well treats you well then he s a fool you re just as well hope it gives you hell now , you ll never see what you ve done to me you can take back your memories they re no good to me and here s all your lies you can look me in the eyes with that sad , sad look that you wear so well when you see my face hope it gives you hell hope it gives you hell when you walk my way hope it gives you hell hope it gives you hell if you find a man that s worth a damn and treats you well treats you well then he s a fool you re just as well hope it gives you hell when you see my face hope it gives you hell hope it gives you hell when you walk my way hope it gives you hell hope it gives you hell when you hear this song and sing along well , you ll never tell cause then you re a fool i m just as well hope it gives you hell when you hear this song i hope that it will give you hell you can sing along i hope that it will treat you well will"

"if he were dating , say , popular pretty girls like us he would go from dumpy to smokin"
i ve met someone else a boy who s finally worthy of my talent and love
"oh , you re already seeing someone else and you were just making out with me"
"okay , look , jesse and i might not be true love , but what if we are ? i know who i am"
"and how many chances at this am i gonna get ? if you don t break up with him , you re out"
but we can all quit if mr
anything else ? sometimes i forget my middle name
"well , rachel , if i weren t ignoring what these ladies were saying out of an overwhelming sense of deep repulsion i would probably hear them encouraging you to go for it with your carmel high beau"
if not join the club
"i have to ask you something and i need you to tell me the truth , because if you don t there will be consequences life and death consequences"
because if i give myself to you and it turns out that you re just playing me i might die
"and you know why ? cause if you want to be as riveting a performer as madonna a skill that will nab us nationals this year you re going to have to start thinking like her , acting like her"
"if that makes me a bitch , okay"
what if then he got really crabby and left and didn t even take home the care bear i won him playing skee ball ? would you please stop talking ? you re grossing out my baby
"however , if you re planning on getting all up on this i m gonna need you to make some changes"
"you ve got the pow , and i believe you should work it more if we re going to be an item"

"all my people in the crowd grab a partner take it down it s me against the music it s just me and me yeah come on ho hey , brittany are you ready uh huh are you ooh no one cares it s whippin my hair it s pullin my waist to hell with stairs the sweat is drippin all over my face to hell and no one s there i m the only one dancin up in this place it s just me tonight i m here feel the beat of the drum gotta get with that bass i m up against the speaker tryin to take on the music it s like a competition me against the beat i wanna get in the zone get in the zone i wanna get in the zone i wanna get in the zone if you really wanna battle saddle up and get your rhythm tryin to hit it , chic a tah in a minute , i m a take you on i m a take you on i m a take you on hey , hey , hey all my people on the floor let me see you dance let me see ya all my people wantin more let me see you dance i wanna see ya all my people round and round let me see you dance let me see ya all my people in the crowd let me see you dance i wanna see ya get on the floor baby , lose control yeah just work your body uh huh and let it go let it go if you wanna party just grab somebody hey , brittany we can dance all night long hey , brittany you say you wanna lose control come over here i got somethin to show ya sexy lady i d rather see you bare your soul if you think you re so hot better show me what you got all my people in the crowd let me see you dance come on , brittany lose control watch you take it down get on the floor baby , lose control just work your body and let it go if you wanna party just grab somebody hey , brittany we can dance all night long all my people on the floor said let me see you dance all my people in the crowd said let me see you dance all my people in the crowd let me see you dance come on , brittany lose control watch you take it down you re really hot"
what if i tell you i don t think i could do that ? rinse
"how would you feel if i continued to come after her ? okay , fine"
she doesn t even care if her hair gets messed up
so you have my blessing to rejoin the football team if you can
"well , it s not that far to paradise at least it s not for me and if the wind is right we can sail away and find tranquillity get out of the car"
"hey , home wrecker ! do i have to remind you that we are divorced ? i am reminded every month when i get my spousal support check the one that i know you can t send me if you re buying a car that you can t afford ! emma"
"squad , so if the plane did go down , it wouldn t be that big a deal"
"can i go now , please ? you re gonna have to turn around when i stand up if you know what i mean"
"i just know that if we can show what i can do to coach b , she d put me on the team"
"schue , if i may kurt , i overheard what you guys were just talking about , and i know what you re gonna say"
"if you guys want to do britney at this year s homecoming assembly , i m fine with it"
the only way that this relationship is gonna work is if we re both losers
"it s so , so exciting ! you know , i can get you backstage if you want"
if you see any awkward teenage frottage you perform that citizen s arrest we practiced
"run the other way ! how you doing , sue ? not sure if you heard , william , but my spinal column was ruptured in a sex riot"
so why would you want to be someone else when the someone that you already are is so amazing ? because the boring someone i already am wasn t good enough for you
i d be lying if i said i didn t have feelings for you
"there s someone else , and you know who that is"
i m really happy that her music has inspired so many of you even if that inspiration was brought about by a dangerous narcotic
"when i was younger i saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind he broke his own heart as i watched as he tried to reassemble it and my mama swore she would never let herself forget and that was the day that i promised i d never sing of love if it does not exist but , darling you are the only exception you are the only exception you are the only exception you are the only exception oh , oh oh , oh i ve got a tight grip on reality but i can t let go of what s in front of me here i know you re leaving in the morning when you wake up leave me with some kind of proof it s not a dream oh , oh , oh , oh you are the only exception you are the only exception you are the only exception you are the only exception you are the only exception you are the only exception and i m on my way to believing and i m on my way to believing"
the whole point of having something sacred is that it takes precedence over anything else you got going on
if you start giving up stuff like friday night dinners then you got nothing to hold onto
"okay , let s face it , kurt if we don t schedule it , then we don t hang out"
"if we don t hang out , then our lives just go right by each other"
"sorry , uh , but if i wanted to sing about jesus , i d go to church"
what i don t like seeing is people using j money to cramp everybody else s style cause it seems to me that true spirituality or whatever you want to call it is about enjoying the life that you ve been given
"dad ? can you hear me ? if you can hear me , squeeze my hand"
"i didn t go to sunday school , so i don t know if god works the same as a genie and i only get three wishes , but here s the thing"
i did a book report on heart attacks if you want to give it to the doctor
"yeah , well , he s the closest i m ever going to get , okay ? i know it may not look like what everybody else has but i thought we were sort of a family"
our thoughts are all with kurt and i know it s sort of hard to really focus on anything else mr
"otherwise , god s kind of a jerk , isn t he ? i mean , he makes me gay , and then has his followers going around telling me it s something that i chose as if someone would choose to be mocked every single day of their life"
"well , william , if your kids want to praise jesus in class i suggest they enroll at sweet holy mother of god academy on i love jesus street , but not here"
don t you think that s just a little bit arrogant ? it s as arrogant as telling someone how to believe in god and if they don t accept it no matter how openhearted or honest their dissent they re going to hell
"well , that doesn t sound very christian , does it ? well , if that s what you believe , that s fine but please keep it to yourself"
sam s a good dude i just think that i can deliver your message to the world more powerfully if i m the most popular guy in the school again
she s gonna see if acupuncture will improve the circulation to my dad s brain
"schue , if i may ? yeah"
"now i just feel like everybody else you know , like we re all just floating around in space"
"oh , life is bigger it s bigger than you and you are not me the lengths that i will go to the distance in your eyes i ve said enough that s me in the corner that s me in the spotlight losing my religion trying to keep up with you and i don t know if i can do it oh , no , i ve said too much i haven t said enough i thought that i heard you laughing i thought that i heard you sing i think i thought i saw you try but that was just a dream just a dream , just a dream dream i thought we couldn t sing songs about religion"
and i know we have all of our own worries and troubles but if we could just put them aside and focus all of our prayers and give them to burt hummel and to my friend kurt
"if god had a name what it would it be and would you call it to his face if you were faced with him in all his glory what would you ask if you had just one question and yeah , yeah god is great yeah , yeah god is good yeah , yeah , yeah yeah , yeah , yeah oh what if god was one of us what if god was one of us oh , just a slob like one of us just a slob like one of us just a stranger on the bus trying to make his way home just trying to make his way home just trying to make his way home kids really wanted to do this song , sue , so i let em"
so if we do a duet together we will be the undisputed top bitches at this school
"if he sings with you , you re painting a bull s eye on his back"
"but the fact of the matter is , the way you were all over me last year if i did that to a girl , she d take out a restraining order"
"if he sings with you , i guarantee , within a week he ll take so much crap , he ll have to quit glee club"
"don t go breakin my heart i couldn t if i tried oh , honey , if i get restless baby , you re not that kind don t go breakin my heart you take the weight off of me oh , honey when you knock on my door ooh , i gave you my key ooh hoo nobody knows it but when i was down i was your clown ooh hoo nobody knows it nobody knows it but right from the start i gave you my heart ohh ohh i gave you my heart don t go breakin my heart i won t go breakin your heart don t go breakin my don t go breakin my don t go breakin my heart don t go breakin my don t go breakin my heart ohh , ohh ohh ohh ohh , ohh yeah we re totally gonna win this thing"
i m only really generous if there s something in it for me
"no , if we wanna win at nationals , then sam has to win this contest"
i don t even know if i can sing
"if you get just a little off course , you re gonna get crushed"
"everyone else does , and we re living in their world"
the blueberry flavor is the worst especially if it gets down your pants
"when i was a little girl i had a rag doll only doll i ve ever owned now i love you just the way i loved that rag doll but only now my love has grown and it gets stronger in every way and it gets higher day by day do i love you my , oh , my river deep , mountain high yeah , yeah , yeah if i lost you , would i cry oh , how i love you , baby baby , baby , baby i love you , baby like a flower loves the spring and i love you , baby like a robin loves to sing and i love you , baby like a schoolboy loves his bag and i love you , baby river deep , mountain high oh , baby oh , baby oh , baby ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh , yeah yeah eah do i love you my , oh , my , yeah river deep , mountain high yeah , yeah , yeah if i lost you , would i cry oh , how i love you , baby baby , baby , baby whoo ! again , again , again ! ladies , nice work"
you can do your duet with someone else in glee
if we want to lose we have to do a song that s bad
"i just thought if we won we could share a nice , free dinner together as friends"
if you ll excuse me
"schue , if i may"
"see , i really couldn t sing i could never really sing what i couldn t do is sing i have trouble with the note it goes all around my throat it s a terrifying thing see , i really couldn t hear which note was lower or was higher which is why i disappear if someone says let s start a choir hey , when i begin to squeak it s a cross between a shriek and a quiver or a moan it s a little like a croak or the record player broke what it doesn t have is tone oh , i know you re thinking what a crazy ding a ling but i really couldn t sing i could never really sing what i couldn t do is sing but what i lack in pitch i sure make up in power and all my friends say i am perfect for the shower still , i m terrific at a dance cause i m messing up my pants i m a birdie on the wing but if i begin to chirp they say who s the little twerp going pong instead of ping and when christmas comes and all my friends go caroling it is so dishearten ing it is so disquiet ing it is so discourage ing darling , please stop answer ing see , i really couldn t sing i could never really sing what i couldn t do is do re mi fa so la ti do do re mi fa so la ti do la la la la sing , sing , sing , sing , sing , sing sing , sing , sing , sing sing sing wow ! now , that is a duet ! thank you , tina , for introducing us to the amazing voice of mike chang ! yeah ! that was good"
"if that puckerman kid ever gets out of jail , he s gonna beat my ass"
because we re gonna have to spend a lot of time together practicing if we re gonna win that dinner at breadsticks
but the only thing that you can give brittany that she can t get from someone else is super choice parking
"but did you ever think how much it means to me ? after my accident , we didn t know if i d ever be able even to do that"
"so , i was wondering if you would maybe want to sing a duet with me"
i think if i went through what you went through last year i would ve transferred to a school on the moon out of embarrassment
figured if i looked like swayze in point break people might think i was a surfer or something
i would ve gotten away with it if it hadn t been for kurt and his sixth sense
"you know how i ve always been very anti halloween cause it totally freaks me out to think about eating candy that someone else has touched , right ? well , carl and i are gonna dress up as characters from the show and we re actually gonna go trick or treating"
"well , i m thinking you re gonna have to edit the whole thing out if you re gonna get sue and figgins to sign off on it"
do you mind if we sit ? we loved sue s corner last night
earlier today artie asked if he could make a gigantic omelet when i m done with the ostrich eggs i m smuggling in my bra
"the river was deep but i swam it janet the future is ours so let s plan it janet so please don t tell me to can it janet i ve one thing to say and that s dammit , janet i love you the road was long but i ran it janet there s a fire in my heart and you fan it janet if there s one fool for you then i am it janet i ve one thing to say and that s dammit , janet i love you here s a ring to prove that i m no joker there s three ways that love can grow that s good , bad or mediocre oh , j a n e t i love you so oh , it s nicer than betty monroe had oh , brad now we re engaged and i m so glad oh , brad that you met mom and you know dad oh , brad i ve one thing to say and that s , brad i m mad for you too what made you think you could get away with doing this show without my knowledge ? i didn t"
"if i miss a workout or eat a hot dog , i hate myself for a few days but the fact is , if i wanna be cool if i wanna get quinn for good , i gotta look the part"
if you get up on that stage and look like the pillsbury doughboy no way you re staying popular
"i m not sure if you know this about me , but i am a huge proponent of the arts in schools , and , well , even at this very school gosh , we re failing"
but don t you think it s inappropriate in a high school musical ? at least if i play eddie i won t have to grind up against the students
if i did it i d be showing my support for the arts
"i thought maybe i would save it for the opening , if that s okay"
i m i m sorry ? i figured if carl can play eddie then i can play rocky
okay ? um i guess if you wanna start over there and i will start here
"i felt there s no use getting into heavy sweating it only leads to trouble and bad fretting now all i want to know is how to go i ve tasted blood and i want more more , more , more i ll put up no resistance i want to stay the distance i ve got an itch to scratch i need assistance touch a , touch a , touch a touch me i wanna be dirty thrill me , chill me , fulfill me creature of the night then if anything shows while you pose i ll oil you up and drop you down down , down , down and that s just one small fraction of the main attraction oh i want a friendly man oh ! and i need action touch a , touch a , touch a touch me i wanna be dirty thrill me , chill me , fulfill me creature of the night touch a , touch a , touch a touch me i wanna be dirty thrill me , chill me , fulfill me creature of the night oh , touch a , touch a , touch a touch me oh ! i wanna be dirty thrill me , chill me fulfill me creature of the night creature of the night"
"to be honest , your motivations for doing this production are murky to me considering all that you are risking if something goes too far"
"what are you saying ? i m saying you re welcome to continue with this but if you get any heat about it , i won t be able to protect you"
and if i really love you i need to back off and accept the fact that at least for now being with him is the best thing for you
"i don t care ! if you re on this football team , you ll wear a cup"
"i don t know what that is , but if i find out it s bad the fury s gonna find you"
"can i be honest with you ? you , like everyone else at this school , are too quick to let homophobia slide"
"now , if you ll excuse me"
i won t get mad at you if you tell me the truth
what if coach beiste were to find out about it ? think about how hurt she d be
"it was like hey , if you re gay , your life s just gonna be miserable"
"you two show up at breadsticks tomorrow night around and if we don t find hotter chicks to date tonight , we might show up"

"if i m gonna be honest , no"
"you know , i remember something else that baby loves a lot"
"it s , like , if marriage is so sacred , they should just outlaw divorce"
i know it s not on your menu but i was wondering if you guys had you want some tots
"if you did , you wouldn t have taken my job so easily"
"if we don t listen to it , they just tune us out"
but i guess baby s feeling a lot better if he s healthy enough to have a beer with a friend
"if i leave now , i m never gonna come back"
"question for you ! you tell anyone else what happened how you kissed me ? you kissed me , karofsky"
cause if you do i m gonna kill you
i actually need your help with something else though
"go ! uh huh , uh huh you have my heart and we ll never be worlds apart maybe in magazines but you ll still be my star baby , cause in the dark you can t see shiny cars that s when you ll need me there with you , i ll always share cause i m cause i m singin in the rain just singin in the rain what a glorious feelin i m happy again i m laughing at clouds so dark up above i m singin singin in the rain you can stand under my umbrella ella , ella eh , eh , eh under my umbrella ella , ella eh , eh , eh , eh , eh these fancy things will never come in between you re part of my entity here for infinity when the world has took its part when the world has dealt its cards if the hand is hard together , we ll mend your heart cause i m singin in the rain just singin in the rain what a glorious feelin i m happy again i m laughing at clouds so dark up above i m singin singin in the rain you can stand under my umbrella ella , ella just singin in the rain i m singin singin in the rain eh , eh , eh it s rainin , rainin ooh , baby , it s rainin , rainin baby , come here to me come here to me it s rainin , rainin i m singin in the rain ooh , baby , it s rainin , rainin just singin in the rain baby , come here to me the sun s in my heart and i m ready for love my umbrella eh eh , eh eh eh my umbrella eh eh , eh eh eh my umbrella eh , eh , eh , eh eh eh my umbrella english us sdh"

"until then , will you accept this promise ring ? what are you , six ? if you accept this ring will symbolize my promise to you to be true to never pressure you to do anything more than kiss to listen to your problems , to tell you when you have food in your teeth , or eye gunk to come over to your house whenever you need something superheavy moved around"
"i guess if i could pull it off , it would make me seem like a cool stud"
"if he gets in a fight with him , he ll be sent back to juvie"
"so now , if you ll excuse us"
if something bad happens to kurt and we didn t do anything to stop it we ll never be able to live with ourselves
"if he gets pissed at me , i m gonna get sacked more times than jay cutler which means we re gonna lose , which means beiste is gonna make sam quarterback"
we both know i can help him more if i stay on top
"if he wants to be a homo , that s up to him , but don t rub it in my face"
"where were you , finn ? i was still out on the field , okay ? i totally would have given him a beat down if i d been there"
and if uncle andy s th birthday party was any indication you re gonna need some work
there s something else you re not telling me
he said he would kill me if i told anyone
if you told anyone what ? just that he was picking on me
"if you don t think this is fair , you can appeal to the school board"
if you were honest and told people that we did it last year you would go from uncool to chilly willy in a heartbeat
"if she found out , she d break up with me"
"i mean , if you two broke up , we d be free to see each other , right ? hey"
"it s a beautiful night we re looking for something dumb to do hey , baby i think i wanna marry you is it the look in your eyes or is it this dancing juice who cares , baby i think i wanna marry you well , i know this little chapel on the boulevard we can go no one will know oh , come on , girl who cares if we re trashed got a pocket full of cash we can blow shots of patron and it s on , girl don t say no , no , no , no , no just say yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah and we ll go , go , go , go , go if you re ready like i m ready cause it s a beautiful night we re looking for something dumb to do hey , baby i think i wanna marry you is it the look in your eyes or is it this dancing juice who cares , baby i think i wanna marry you just say i do tell me right now , baby tell me right now , baby , baby just say i do cause it s a beautiful night we re looking for something dumb to do hey , baby i think i wanna marry you just say i do is it the look in your eyes or is it this dancing juice who cares , baby i think i wanna marry you please , be seated"
"and quite frankly , no one else has shown me as much as you about what it means to be a man"
okay ? even if it means getting a slushee in the face every now and then
"oh , her eyes , her eyes make the stars look like they re not shinin her hair , her hair falls perfectly without her tryin she s so beautiful and i tell her every day oh , you know , you know , you know i d never ask you to change if perfect s what you re searching for then just stay the same so , don t even bother asking if you look okay you know i ll say when i see your face there s not a thing that i would change cause you re amazing you re amazing just the way you are and when you smile when you smile the whole world stops and stares for a while cause , girl , you re amazing you re amazing just the way you are the way you are the way you are girl , you re amazing just the way you are when i see your face there s not a thing that i would change cause you re amazing you re amazing just the way you are and when you smile the whole world stops and stares for a while cause , girl , you re amazing just the way you are yeah well , i hope the real wedding is more exciting than the rehearsal"
i would be honored if you would be my plus one
"now , if we re gonna beat them , dance"
"warblers , if i may ? now , i can t deny that the warblers vocals are absolutely dreamy but i believe our set for sectionals this year should have a little more showbiz panache"
just tell me if it s true
"i thought if i told you the truth , you d get so mad at me and you re kind of scary"
is there anything else you wanna talk about ? what are you doing ? we ve been looking for you all day
"and if i did , i wasn t alone"
"i m gonna pretend i didn t hear that because if i did , i d be down to glee club members which , as you probably remember from the rule book is two less than we need to compete at sectionals"
"if the warblers win sectionals , it s only because we gave them kurt"
"if we lose , we should throw possums"
"and if they win , we will congratulate them because that s who we are"
so i asked her if she wanted to join
"i promised him that if he got me outta there , i d start being nicer to people"
you re not gonna make it as a warbler if all you care about is getting noticed
"schuester , not that i really care but if we don t leave now , we re gonna miss the competition"
"oh , wow , if you didn t get a solo , then they must be really good"
you know what ? you guys are gonna have to find somebody else to mindlessly harmonize in the background because i m not going onstage with him
"look , i don t care if you guys hate each other"
you know what else is a serious good time ? taking two minutes to save a life by filling out an organ donor card because it s never too late to donate
can t have couple s counseling if you re not a couple
happiness hit her like a train on a track coming towards her stuck still no turning back she hid around corners and she hid under beds she killed it with kisses and from it she fled the dog days are over the dog days are done the horses are coming so you better run run fast for your mother run fast for your father run for your children for your sisters and your brothers leave all your love and your loving behind you can t carry it with you if you want to survive the dog days are over the dog days are done can you hear the horses cause here they come and i never wanted anything from you except everything you had and what was left after that too oh run fast for your mother run fast for your father run for your children for your sisters and your brothers leave all your love and your loving behind you can t carry it with you if you want to survive the dog days are over the dog days are done can you hear the horses cause here they come dog days are over dog days are done here they come english us sdh
"that s very sweet of you guys , but i i think it s best if we just keep things separate for a while"
"we re on the island of misfit toys here we don t wanna stay we wanna travel with santa claus in his magic sleigh a pack full of toys means a sack full of joys for millions of girls and for millions of boys when christmas day is here the most wonderful day of the year a jack in the box waits for children to shout wake up don t you know that it s time to come out ? when christmas day is here the most wonderful day of the year toys galore scattered on the floor there s no room for more and it s all because of santa claus a scooter for jimmy a dolly for sue the kind that will even say how do you do ? when christmas day is here the most wonderful day of the year how would you like to be a spotted elephant ? or a choo choo with square wheels on your caboose ? or a water pistol that shoots jelly ? we re all misfits ! if we re on the island of unwanted toys we ll miss all the fun with the girls and the boys when christmas day is here the most wonderful , wonderful wonderful , wonderful wonderful day of the year hey , guys"
"classrooms in this school with students in them ? well , if there are no students in them there will be no one to put money in the collection box while we sing"
if brittany sees that we all still believe it ll make her strong enough to withstand all the santa naysayers in the world
"i really can t stay but , baby , it s cold outside i ve got to go away but , baby , it s cold outside this evening has been been hoping that you d drop in so very nice i ll hold your hands they re just like ice my mother will start to worry beautiful , what s your hurry ? my father will be pacing the floor listen to the fireplace roar so really i d better scurry beautiful please don t hurry but maybe just half a drink more put some records on while i pour the neighbors might faint baby , it s bad out there say , what s in this drink no cabs to be had out there i wish i knew how your eyes are like starlight now to break this spell i ll take your hat your hair looks swell i ought to say no , no , no , sir mind if i move in closer ? at least i m gonna say that i tried what s the sense in hurtin my pride ? i really can t stay baby , don t hold out baby , it s cold outside oh , but it s cold outside i ve gotta get home but , baby , you d freeze out there say , lend me your coat it s up to your knees out there you ve really been grand i thrill when you touch my hand but don t you see ? how can you do this thing to me ? there s bound to be talk tomorrow think of my lifelong sorrow at least there will be plenty implied if you got pneumonia and died i really can t stay get over that holdout oh , baby oh , but it s cold outside i think you re ready"
"i don t know if you know this , but i am really bad at christmas shopping"
and if you take my property out of my office i will pick up that phone and have you arrested for theft
if christmas morning comes around and i m not dancing in glee club rehearsal with no personal explanation from her idol she s gonna lose faith in old st
"well , this way , if anyone sees us we ll have plausible deniability"
"i wrapped it up and sent it with a note saying i love you i meant it now i know what a fool i ve been but if you kissed me now i know you d fool me again last christmas i gave you my heart and the very next day you gave it away gave it away this year , to save me from tears i ll give it to someone special oh , oh last christmas i gave you my heart oh , oh but the very next day you gave me away this year , to save me from tears oh i ll give it to someone special i ll give it to someone special last year for christmas , i asked santa to give me you"
"if barbra can pull off a bob , so can i"
"well , if you actually read it , you d know what it s about"
early s late if you make tomorrow yesterday
is there anything else that you want ? like anything ? no
i don t know if i can tell you
"if santa isn t magical , i don t even know if i wanna believe anymore"
"if you don t mind , i think i m gonna take her home , make sure she s okay"
"so if you want , come over to my house"
"so if no one we know bought it for you , then santa brought it"
"i figure if i stay on you , you ll run away like your little butt buddy hummel"
"you say this could shoot someone across a football field ? oh , several football fields if you pack in enough explosives"
"you see , if you wanted to go for more than , say , yards you re looking at about a chance of catastrophic failure"
"if you don t have the talent , you rely on the chemistry"
"do you trust me ? you re not gonna try and kiss me again , are ya ? if you trust me i think i know a way to get your team united again"
"if i have to stay , i m not singing no show tunes"
picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor reaching for the phone cause i can t fight it anymore and i wonder if i ever crossed your mind for me it happens all the time it s a quarter after i m all alone and i need you now said i wouldn t call but i lost all control and i need you now and i don t know how i can do without i just need you now another shot of whiskey can t stop looking at the door wishing you d come sweepin in the way you did before and i wonder if i ever cross your mind for me it happens all the time it s a quarter after i m all alone and i need you now and i said i wouldn t call but i m a little drunk and i need you now and i don t know how i can do without i just need you now whoo ! whoo ! the girl with the mohawk had a really nice voice
"sue pulled the cheerios from the game , so if we don t do it , there s no halftime show"
"i think the cheerleading competition is gonna be a lot of fun but if you go , you re gonna miss out on us doing the most iconic song of all time the super bowl of pop anthems thriller"
if you took that energy you used bullying people and put it into this you d be one of the most talented guys in the school
"you think maybe we should do a warm up number or something before we do that big thriller thing at halftime ? you know , i figure the only way i m gonna keep any street cred around here after dancing around like an idiot in front of the whole school is if we kick ass at it"
what the hell are we gonna do ? if we go to our cheerleading competition then we miss the halftime show and we re out of glee club
maybe someone else could
"if we all quit , you barely have enough guys to play next week"
"if we stand together , we do the halftime show we can win this game and be kings in this place"
"at first we started out real cool taking me places i ain t never been but now you re getting comfortable and doing those things you did no more you re slowly making me pay for things your money should be handling and now you ask to use my car car driving all day and don t fill up the tank and you have the audacity to even come and step to me ask to hold some money from me until you get your check next week you triflin , good for nothin type of brother silly me why haven t i found another ? a baller , when times get hard , i need someone to help me out instead of a scrub like you who don t know what a man s about can you pay my bills ? can you pay my telephone bills ? do you pay my automo bills ? if you did , then maybe we could chill i don t think you do so you and me are through you triflin , good for nothin type of brother silly me why haven t i found another ? a baller , when times get hard , i need someone to help me out instead of a scrub like you who don t know what a man s about can you pay my bills ? can you pay my telephone bills ? do you pay my automo bills ? can you pay my bills ? if you did , then maybe we could chill i don t think you do , no so so you and me are through you triflin , good for nothin type of brother silly me why haven t i found another ? you triflin , good for nothin type of brother oh , silly me why haven t i found another ? can you pay my bills ? can you pay my telephone bills ? do you pay my automo bills ? pay my telephone , telephone bills i don t think you do so you and me are through can you pay my bills ? oh , no can you pay my telephone bills ? do you pay my automo bills ? can you pay my bills ? if you did , then maybe we could chill said i don t think you do no , no so you and me are through so you and me are through guys , i d say we re ready for regionals"
"i hope he realizes that , you know , if he and i were still together i could make him feel a lot better , you know"
high school regulations actually let you play a couple guys short if you want to
but if they figure out a way to make it work you can bet that we ll definitely be there to cheer them on
we carry this thing through even if it means having to forfeit the game
i guess they won t get hurt if you stay down
"and if you refuse to sign this well , those little baby cannons might just go hungry"
is anyone else tired of lying down all the time ? i want to play
"haven t you been paying attention ? if we re not cheerios , we re nothing"
if you didn t think it would hurt your reputation which would you choose ? glee club
if you leave i have no performance ! sucks for you
she will if you come out and perform at the halftime show
not if the quarterback fumbles the snap
"so , i was thinking maybe we could go together to dalton and apologize to him , if who said i wanted to join the glee club permanently ? i just thought , after this week , and and the way we won the game , and the way you came out to dance what do you think ? we all dance around together and win a football game and everything s gonna change ? glee club s gonna be cool and we re all gonna sing hippie peace songs every morning ? maybe"
"we needed a th member , and i told her if she joined the glee club i d give her seven minutes in heaven"
i know i can pry her away from sam if i can get her to kiss me again
cause you always just seem to be meddling in everybody else s business
"how about you let me take you to breadstix for valentine s day ? you seriously think it s that easy ? i m not desperate , so if you really want this , you best come correct"
"i mean , if finn thinks that he s just gonna walk out of my life , he s wrong"
i gotta keep up with the oral hygiene if i m gonna satisfy all of you
"if he and i got married , the gap would give me a discount"
you can t just bust a groove in the middle of somebody else s workplace
"if we were , i d get arrested , cause you re underage"
"if i have anything , i hope it s not contagious"
or else you wouldn t have come here
whoo ! is anyone else hot ? it s really stuffy in here
"i m not just lookin for somebody to fool around with so if you re really into me , you gotta take it slow"
"do you ever feel like a plastic bag ? drifting through the wind wanting to start again do you ever feel feel so paper thin ? like a house of cards one blow from caving in do you ever feel already buried deep ? six feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing do you know that there s still a chance for you ? cause there s a spark in you you just gotta ignite the light and let it shine just own the night like the fourth of july cause , baby , you re a firework come on , show em what you re worth make em go , oh , oh , oh as you shoot across the sky y y baby , you re a firework come on let your colors burst make em go , oh , oh , oh you re gonna leave em goin , oh , oh , oh baby , you re a firework come on let your colors burst make em go , oh , oh , oh you re gonna leave em goin , oh , oh , oh boom , boom , boom even brighter than the moon , moon , moon boom , boom , boom even brighter than the moon , moon , moon mind if we join you ? i would love that"
"now , if we re gonna put it will"
"i mean , i don t think i have anything else to do"
but it won t work if you insist on wearing them incorrectly
"but would you mind if i borrowed one of your rafters so i could hang myself ? i did a test run back in my office , and you know what ? there s asbestos up there , and that can kill a person"
want me to show you my abs ? if you want to
"the problem is , days later , when they come down from their see s candy high they crash , and everything else by comparison is humdrum"
"uh , what s goin on ? we re joining the justin bieber experience , if sam s cool with it"
"and if not , we re starting our own band"
"gotta , gotta keep it feels so right gotta , gotta gotta , gotta keep it close oh feels so right oh , oh for you i d write a symphony i d tell the violin it s time to sink or swim watch them play for ya for you i d be whoa , whoa running a thousand miles , just get to where you are step to the beat of my heart i don t need a whole lot but for you i admit i d rather give you the world or we can share mine i know i won t be the first one giving you all this attention baby , listen i just need somebody to love i don t need too much just somebody to love somebody to love i don t need nothing else i promise , girl , i swear i just need somebody to love i need somebody i i need somebody i need somebody i i need somebody every day i ll bring the sun around i sweep away the clouds smile for me i would take every second every single time spend it like my last dime step to the beat of my heart i don t need a whole lot but for you i admit i d rather give you the world or let you share mine i know i won t be the first one giving you all this attention baby , listen i just need somebody to love no , no , no , no , no i don t need too much just somebody to love somebody to love oh , i i don t need nothing else i promise , girl , i swear i just need somebody to love somebody to love somebody to love oh , oh , oh i need somebody i swear , i just need somebody to love whoo ! bieber ! nice"
"so if i were gonna give you a grade , c plus"

"yeah yeah , hey ooh , ooh , ooh every single day i walk down the street i hear people say baby , so sweet ever since puberty everybody stares at me boys , girls i can t help it , baby so be kind and don t lose your mind just remember that i m your baby take me for what i am who i was meant to be and if you give a damn take me , baby or leave me take me , baby , or leave me a tiger in a cage can never see the sun this diva needs her stage baby , let s have fun you are the one i choose folks would kill to fill your shoes you love the limelight too now , baby so be mine and don t waste my time cryin , oh , honey bear , are you still my my my baby ? take me for what i am who i was meant to be and if you give a damn take me , baby , or leave me no way can i be what i m not but hey , don t you want your girl hot ? don t fight don t lose your head cause every night who s in your bed ? take me for what i am who i was meant to be and if you give a damn take me , baby oh , take me , baby or leave me or leave me take me , baby or leave me guess i m leaving i m gone oh , my god ! that was so great ! no"

"if unique identifies as a girl and dresses as a girl , she should be allowed to play one onstage"
"and if you choose to cast rizzo with a naive , gender confused boy in a dress , i guarantee you someone is going to raise a very public stink about it , and i don t think that s fair"
but maybe you could have called and asked if i could handle you choreographing the school musical ! i m sorry
"it s weird for me , too , but if that s what s stopping you from auditioning for grease , then we have to make this not weird"
let s see if you have the stuff to back it up
so now all you got to worry about is getting a curly way and i ll take care of coach sue or anybody else who might try and st us

"okay ? cause the only secret is that your brain works a little differently than everyone else s , that s it"
"for , i ll clean your pool , and if you give me , i ll give you the greatest night of your life"
"okay , what are you supposed to do when you really like a girl , but you didn t know it at first , then you sort of blew your shot with her , and now this other dude s really into her who you used to think was a total poser , but turns out he s actually a really cool guy who totally has your back , and you know you ll be a world class d bag if you jump in now and try to break them up ? whoa , whoa , whoa , back it up"
"if you ask me , it s just another way to punish yourself"
"even if he doesn t , you got to forgive yourself"

"i m sitting in a railway station got a ticket for my destination oh oh on a tour of one night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand and every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one man band this wave wave is stringing us along along just know you re not alone cause i m gonna make this place your home every day s an endless stream of cigarettes and magazines oh , oh oh and each town looks the same to me the movies and the factories and every stranger s face i see reminds me that i long to be the trouble , it might drag you down if you get lost , you can always be found just know you re not alone know you re not alone cause i m gonna make this place your home oh oh oh oh oh , oh , oh oh oh oh know you re not alone where my music s playing oh , oh oh , oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh i m gonna make , i m gonna make make this place our home ah ah ah , ah ah ah ah ah , ah , ah , ah know you re not alone ah ah ah , ah ah ah ah , ah ah"

"i ll end it if you want me to , but for the record , i wasn t just gonna hump her and dump her"
"if finn hadn t paired us together , i would ve thrown such a hissy"

"if you ask me , she just sounds super hung over"
"do you mind if i bring cassie ? oh , shut up"
"who told you that ? i don t need somebody to tell me that the biggest womanizer in school is trying to take advantage of the naive girl who just wants to fit in and be loved , especially if the womanizer s last name is puckerman"
the only way you re gonna win sectionals is if marley s at her best
"and if you keep distracting her , she s not going to be"

"and figured if we all share musical shame with each other , we could all become a more cohesive team for regionals"
"so , besides unique , does anybody else have something they would like to share ? guys , this is a great team building exercise"
"and if anyone ever found out , especially adam , or god forbid , blaine , or even rachel and santana , it would totally destroy me"
"if i m going to be paying a third of the rent , i m going to be needing a third of the shelf space"
"two , you re a bitch , and those are my products , okay ? and maybe if you used them , you wouldn t have more oil than the middle east on your face"

"what if i broke that pact , huh ? what would you do ? attack me with your exfoliating loofah ? okay , she can t find out until after her funny girl audition , all right ? that would wreck her"

"um i mean , i i ve known all year , and you know , frankly , i m an attractive guy , and you are into dudes , and if you weren t into me , i d probably be pretty offended"
"first , the meteor misses us and we go to regionals and we kick butt , which will only happen if we prepare"
"or we only have a few days to live and if that s the case , we need to say everything we need to say to the people we love"
"bruce springsteen always says that he plays every show as if it s his last , and that is the kind of urgency we need at regionals this year"
"that way , you know , he ll see how much you love him , and everybody else in the glee club will stop feeling like you re choosing a cat over them"
"if i know you the way i think i do , you re gonna love it even more after"

"saying i love you is not the words i want to hear from you it s not that i want you not to say , but if you only knew how easy it would be to show me how you feel more than words is all you have to do to make it real then you wouldn t have to say that you love me cause i d already know what would you do if my heart was torn in two more than words to show you feel that your love for me is real what would you say if i took those words away then you couldn t make things new just by saying i love you"
"and if it hits , we re all gonna be deader than a bunch of baby chickens fighting a dachshund"

"if you look under it , um there s a journal with a bunch of songs that i wrote"
what if it wasn t even a gun ? you ever think about that ? cops didn t find one
"okay , so what if it is kitty ? would it really be that bad ? you have to admit , she has been much cooler lately , and maybe the only way she can be completely honest is by being anonymous"
"what if it s that bass player with the bowl cut , or brad , the piano player ? w whoever it is , i ll find out at"
"look , he s your cat , and if he s important to you , he s important to me , too"

"thing is , if i let you go for free and anybody hears about that , the whole system could collapse"
"if the producers are smart , they re not gonna be looking for some carbon copy"
i don t know if it s any good
"um , how i wouldn t be the person i am today , standing in front of you , doing what i m doing right now if they hadn t shown me that i could"
if they hadn t believed in me
"who cares ? but if you re a crappy teacher , that means something"
"so here s the deal if you want to stay on board as co captain of the cheerios ! , you re gonna have to take a blood oath and loyalty pledge"
"but if i do , things have got to be different"
and and i m sorry if i made any of you feel like you don t have a voice in this room
"and i know someone else who does , too"
if that s okay
"well , no news is good news , right ? cookie ? at this point , if i haven t heard anything life goes on"
"honestly , something so special and something magical happened in that room , and if those producers are too narrow minded or star obsessed oh , my god"
"if the darkness persists , candles and flashlights will be distributed based on grade point average"
if this were to get out wait
"all right , you know what , rachel , if you are still obsessing over what you re gonna sing at your funny girl callback , may i suggest your best jam ever , run , joey , run"
"if anyone else does this , i i will literally die"
"and listen , um , if you want to draft a couple of friends to help you out , that s good , too"
"fact , if i hadn t mistaken you for a butch israeli girl , i would ve never let you in here"
"and imagine how we could get everybody working together if we pushed ourselves to pull off a song with nothing but a water bottle and pencils and a zipper , and who knows what else"
"and guess who gets to attend if they just volunteer a few short hours ? anne hathaway ? it s us , it s us ! are you serious ? and just when you thought it couldn t get any gayer , it does"
"if it wasn t for ballet , i wouldn t be here"

but i m not sure if i could trust that person to keep it secret
"it may have seemed like no one else in that room understood what you went through , but i did"
"miss isabelle , i m sorry , i know that we re just volunteers here , but kurt and i were wondering if there was any possibility that we could maybe watch the performance from the audience"
"up a steep and very narrow stairway to the voice like a metronome up a steep and very narrow stairway it wasn t paradise it wasn t paradise it wasn t paradise but it was home mother always said i d be very attractive when i grew up , when i grew up different , she said , with a special something and a very , very personal flair and though i was eight or nine though i was eight or nine though i was eight or nine i hated her now , different is nice , but it sure isn t pretty pretty is what it s about i never met anyone who was different who couldn t figure that out so beautiful i d never live to see but it was clear if not to her well , then to me"

"four if you include the bootleg that my friend kurt has , so"
"if we can push ourselves to a whole new level , like the beatles did constantly we can win back to back national championships and form a new directions dynasty"

"i have been given the post of interim principal at this school a post that will be made permanent at the end of the year if all goes according to plan , allowing me to demolish this office down to the studs ridding it once and for all of the deep ethnic musk that is figgins s hallmark"
"you re not firing us ? not if you win a national championship , i m not"
"however , if you fail to win at nationals , i will fire you and you ll be forced to build creepy relationships with teenagers on your own time"
"well , if i understand your question , tina yes , the early beatles always had each other s backs"
i don t think i m ever gonna find someone else who s gonna make me feel like that
"as if , in every lifetime that you and i have ever lived we have chosen to come back and find each other and fall in love all over again"
"if i got it , i would ve heard by now"
"honestly , if it were anyone else , i d be so jealous"
"now if that s true , you might wanna tie yourself down because this is gonna be a rough ride"
"and if we re not careful , i swear to god we re gonna have a black transsexual named unique as prom queen before we have a cheerio as prom queen"
and that s not gonna happen if you re off campaigning for kimchi cohen barf or whoever
i literally want you to tell me if you re mentally slow so i can be sure you re not nominated for future prom courts
"well , what if i told you that the beatles wrote exactly zero songs about what it feels like when you tell a girl that you don t think is hot you ll go to prom with her because you feel bad"
"hey , i would watch your tone with me if i were you , busted timberfake"

if i don t get this all out now i don t think i ll ever stop crying
"you know , if it s , uh , okay with everyone i think i d like to keep that lamp"
"if i were you , i would choose my next few words very carefully"
"that if i start crying , i don t think i ll ever stop"
if there s one thing i ve learned from finn dying it s that shame is a wasted emotion
"when we had sex , finn never stopped asking me if i was okay the whole time"
and i don t think he would have done all those things if he didn t think you were decent too
if we were rounding up the usual suspects that would pretty much just be you
but if you did all i m gonna say is that all of us want some piece of finn to keep close to us
"i figured if i don t have finn , i need an army to help me"
"you know , if finn was around , i d just keep letting him point me in the right direction"
"i felt like i didn t know if i would be able to sing again , but now i know that i can"

"i know it s not my band , so i m not gonna tell you what to do but as your best friend and your biggest fan what i love the most about you is that you don t try to do or be what anyone else is doing"
"uh , came from where ? uh , if you say ohio , i m gonna die"

"will made the club decide whether they were katys or gagas , as if those were the only options , which sue thought was stupid"

"i didn t want a tramp stamp , and i thought if i got it on my arm then i wouldn t be able to go sleeveless again"
what if i run into dan savage in the steam room at the gym ? i ll be humiliated
"well , well , if it isn t the q in the lgbtq xyz who gives a crap ? you want me to warm that seat up for you , sweetheart ? listen , we get it"

"okay , seriously , i m not gonna be able to survive if you and your hagberry are gonna be tickling those ivories belting out gay hits from rent and showboat all day"
i can t say crap or douche ? even if you re talking about graydon carter
"okay , if i m going to be honest here just because we go out once doesn t mean that we re going out"
"it s not like the bitter end or the mercury lounge or and if people associate that place with show tunes nobody s gonna come out for our covers of madonna s greatest hits ? i disagree , dani"
and if you come on too aggressively they might think you re a control freak or a puppet master
"look , i know you re upset that the school board is coming today to evaluate mckinley and to determine if i am worthy to be instated as full time principal"
and if you would like to continue cleaning floors and feeding your family i suggest you do everything you can to make sure this place looks just amazing for this evaluation
"bugged the crap out of me , if i m gonna be totally honest"
i probably would have been prom king if the school didn t have so many stoners
"well , if pulling strings means that i encourage people to reach their fullest potential then hell , yeah , guilty as charged"
"brad , if everyone just wants me to sit down and shut up that s exactly what i m gonna do"
"please , blaine ! please ! please ! yeah , blaine ! really ? well , if you guys insist"
"yeah , look , um , i don t know how else to say this , but there s something going on in the choir room"
i don t know if it s haunted or like a space time rift happening
"as much as i ve really enjoyed learning about yarn these past three months i was wondering since arts and crafts is my senior elective if maybe i could do my own thing and venture into felt and fabric and even yarn and make a puppet ? your request surely begs the question why on earth would an year old man want to make a puppet ? well , it s not just any puppet"
"well , i m sorry if my femininity threatens you"
and if the school board comes here and sees schizophrenic students clearly off their meds talking to puppets they re gonna think i don t have a handle on things
and if i catch you with your hand up the butt of anything that isn t human you re in a world of trouble
if it isn t miss sally field in not without my puppet
"well , principal sylvester gave me detention and she said if i tried to skip it that she was gonna suspend me and put it on my permanent record"
so if you re done being a puppet master do you think you can take your hand out from under my dress ? uh yeah
"so , sit back , relax , have some eggnog and enjoy , if you dare the never aired glee christmas episode"
i m using giada s new recipe but you tell me if it s too much allspice
you can get in on it too if you want
"i would get that part hands down if i wanted it , but i don t"
"but if i were you guys , i would i would leave out the back door"
i can calm things down for today but if you truly want to save christmas for this store and all of you it s gonna take the rest of the week
"if this is something that is important to you , maybe we can talk to mr"
"we all set in there ? if , by all set , you mean did i light the candy cane scented candles on the toilet then , yes , we are all set"
"if we can get kitty to take the role of the virgin mary , get into those vestments and stand in the middle of that nativity scene holding the baby jesus maybe she ll realize she is worthy"
we ve got something else for her too
"there s a , um , part left in the living nativity that no one else can play"
"not if we have something else to make up for it , which i do"
i think i have enough juice to ask if you can be one
"even if for an entire week , the only thing you have to do is say something inconsequential like , kitty s right , or , blaine , are you serious ? wait , we can t both be valedictorian"
"if , during the middle of your speeches you decide to abandon your prepared text in favor of a musical number because the emotions you re feeling are just so complex they can only be expressed in song i promise you , i will dedicate my life to making sure that every beverage you drink until the day you die will have just a tiny little bit of my pee in it"
"i m so nervous , but i don t know if it s because i m excited or scared"
tell me if i look good
"if i don t get in , i m screwed"
maybe i was too busy making costumes and building sets and swaying in the background while everybody else was front and center
"don t you think you might be overreacting ? if anything , i m underreacting"
"but look , if you re really concerned about elliott , don t let on , even for a second"
"if berry s not coming , then neither am i"
"i mean , you could easily be the front man of our band , if you wanted to be do you ? yes"
"come again ? you know what , kurt ? if you really wanna learn , you should you should get your own guitar"
"what if you weren t playing fanny ? if you weren t playing the lead , and i auditioned to be the understudy would you still feel so strongly ? i m arguing on principle"
"if you want to fill this house , we need all the press we can get"
"if we can t be valedictorian , we re glad it s you"
"schue gives me more solos than anyone gay blaine , gay blaine ! when did you break up with pancake face ? uh , becky , i d really appreciate it if you didn t call my fianca pancake face"
"well , if we re gonna go down , i m honored to go down together"
"she only wins if i lose , and i can t be around this negative energy anymore"
"if she never went on that stage , this would be an important job for her"
"you know what ? if you think that she is just some babe in the woods who is perfectly fine with living off of the scraps off of my star sandwich well , then you are naive and willfully ignorant"
"hopefully it won t have to , if i hurry up right now and lie down on the floor of my office and put my feet up in a chair because we were able to achieve a successful emission"
"nipping at my heels here i had to have rupert , my director , ask sidney , my producer if i could have a full band on retainer at all times so i could sing full voice , just to keep my instrument really sharp"
"elliott ! seriously , what would i have done if you d have turned me away at your door ? i was like some heroine from a lost tennessee williams play"
i had nowhere else to go
"you can sing all the chorus parts , if you want"
we have to try them on to see if they fit
"punkin , it don t matter if you got a she goat in heat"
"what i mean is , if you re ready to get pregnant you gotta make it real natural"
"if you and emma are ready to start trying , you gotta stop trying"
"and if you knew berry the way that all of us did , you would be applauding me"
"think again , gay blaine ! if you don t play twister with me , i m calling the cops"
"although , if you can clear out some space for us here i would be happy to settle this lima heights style"
"my feelings are my feelings , and they re not gonna change even if santana admits that she was wrong"
"or for the sake of kurt , we could pretend to be friends , even if it s just for tonight"
"uh , you know , a year ago had someone asked me if i thought i d ever be a part of a singing trio i would have said absolutely"
you would have done the same thing and then you would have fought to take down whoever was in your way even if it was me
if you manage to patch things up at some point i would love to sing with either of you or cook some curry
"hey , artie , uh , you want to join us ? we re just having a little senior moment if you want to , you know , take part"
we were wondering if we could just do one last number
"if memory serves , a quartet is more powerful"
"well , we can if one has already been made"
"if they don t win , the club is finished"
but if the time comes and you need to step up i m gonna be counting on you to get it done
"just go out there and have a blast and , you know , it d be okay if you won the damn thing"
"and if it sells , i don t have to do a lame follow up christmas album"
"d saying that a year old ohio man with a perm had abducted emotionally disturbed teenagers and if he tried to make a reservation , i was to contact the f"
"are you sure we should be doing this ? i mean , if we get caught oh , just go ! trust me , when i was in the warblers sneaking onto stage the night before a show was tradition"
"so should we sing a song or hold hands or say a prayer or something ? because if i m being honest , these ghost lights kind of freak me out"
"if you want something , go down to the eleven"
"i was thinking , if we could find someone out here in l"
"also , if you try to walk , people will look at you weird"
"well , if they were coming , they d be here by now"
"sure , if there was an olympic event in being totally gay ! whoa"
"if you need me over the summer , you can reach me at my beach cottage in saint tropez"
"now if you ll excuse me , i ll make my way to the back of the bus"
it would ve been like a horror movie if i wasn t so awesome
"i said , if you want to meet mother i have to really get to know you first"
and if there s any time left in the day hosting my popular internet talk show
"biff s family is philadelphia main line society and if i get in with that , then my life is set"
if you d like to start paying for it we can t do that
"if i ve said it once , i ve said it a million times the one thing this country needs more of is teen marriage"
"i wouldn t want to follow that number , but if you re still up for it , puck well , you know what ? for my number , i think , uh , we should move to the auditorium"
you know what else is a lie ? when you won prom queen
"doesn t that mean something ? wha a baby ? what happens if we got married and this kid shows up looking for money ? are you crazy ? was this the loser who knocked you up ? yes , yes"
i like teaching a roomful of kids if i know i m never gonna see them again
"but then if you re any good at it , they keep asking you back which kind of defeats the purpose"
"if you want me , i m here"
if it isn t april rhodes america s favorite alcoholic dwarf whore
"but , please , see if you can t involve william in this somehow"
"i got rejected by my backup school , ohio state and brown still hasn t told me if i got in yet"
"ew ! hey ! hey ! if i wanted to watch men in capri pants slobbering all over each other , i d watch monday night football"
"you remember when we first met ? i was in here doing my hair are you trying to make peace with me by getting all nostalgic ? because if so , you are forgetting the one thing that you should have learned from all of our magical time together and it s that i have no heart"
"because if i don t express my venom at least once a day , i get constipated"
"well , once you ve seen a baby come out of a girl s magic garden everything else is easily acceptable"
"santana , for once i d appreciate it if you d keep your inevitable snark to yourself"
"if it wasn t for your dad , i would ve never been prom queen though that was kind of a bad experience for me when i think about it"
little hepburn and tracy wouldn t have a daddy if it wasn t for your dad
i figure that everybody deserves a high school graduation even if it s a year late
if you re going to be of any good to anybody you need to be coaching a glee club
because in this room it doesn t matter if you re gay or straight
if i d let you down when you needed me the most i d never forgive myself
"which means if will wants to coach a glee club , he has to find a new job and he s got a baby on the way"
"what ? no , i can t serve you breakfast in bed if you re not in bed"
is there anything i can do to help ? you can check if the coffee is steeped enough to press
"whoa ! hey , i m rollin here ! watch where you re going ! this city s alive , always moving and i didn t know if i d be able to keep up"
sometimes it s just easier if you stay inside
"hey , if you can sing in the middle of times square you can pretty much do anything"
because if there s one thing i ve learned you can t just sit around waiting for the good things in life to come to you
", and to be honest i don t know if i m gonna feel safe going in the subway anymore"
now if you ll just excuse me i have to go figure out how to put my life back together
"okay , well , stop me if you don t want my opinion"
"how am i gonna be one of the great broadway actors , which was my lifelong dream if i don t have any real life experiences to pull from ? stop the car"
as much as kurt is feeling anxiety about being crowded i m still feeling as if i m living in someone else s home
"if i m gonna be here for a while , then just like pippin i m gonna find my very own corner of the sky"
"well , you re gonna visit us , right ? um , yeah , if i have time , you know"
"and even if i did , kurt loves you"
i told my producers i d be in a much better place if i rode the subway with my friend every day
"every day ? well , if you ll have me"
i ll ride the subway with you and make sure you don t get mugged again if you give me a tongue lashing if i lose my way
"listen , i got to do this paid webcam thing in my room but if you have any other questions , just ask your roommate , sam"
we never really discussed if this was the absolute best thing for our relationship
"it is scary , but i think it s a little less scary if we make the decision together"
"and no matter who we become , even if we do need alone time which is completely valid we ll always belong to each other"
and i have adderall if you want
"oh , and if you have trouble sleeping , marla has ambien"
this is going to sound like one of those crazy new york stories and i wouldn t believe it myself if it hadn t just happened but i swear just tell us
"s okay if you like sunshine all the time , which i don t"
"if you can sing in the middle of times square , you can pretty much do anything"
"if you have any questions , i ll be in my office"
and if i could just make it to this then we ll be into performances and i will be rachel berry nyada sophomore by day and broadway star by night
you mind if i watch it with you ? sure
"if we re gonna do this , we have to set some ground rules , okay ? we have to take it slow"
"i just got a haircut also , if anybody was wondering"
"madam tibideaux ? do you have a moment ? if it s to reschedule your midwinter critique , then yes"
okay ? i don t need nyada anymore especially not if it s gonna hold me back
if you date a white dude you re gonna alienate all the black women you want to buy your album and you re gonna piss off black men too
but what if i don t ? i can t do this
"and i m not sure if that s the statement that i wanna make , not now"
what if this is the last role you ever get ? last role ? really ? wow
she s just we can play the what if game all day long
"if you d been with him , he would ve done the same thing"
"blaine moved out too , even though he and kurt are still getting married but they decided it d be better if they were living apart"
"if a croissant and a doughnut made sweet , sweet love their baby would be a cronut , a flaky yet buoyant sugar kissed pastry of perfection"
"and to be completely honest , i don t know if i m comfortable with that"
"well , actually , you know what ? blaine s not gonna be home for a couple hours , so if you want to go lay down or sam , i think we need to have a conversation"
"and if you need a free clinic , there s one on th street in chelsea"
"if you re nervous about it , i ll go with you"
"if i had , i would ve come in right away"
"if you don t , you re gonna put their health at risk"
"oh , okay , is that it ? i don t know if you heard what i said"
you re not mad ? i m not if you re not
"i m free tomorrow night if you maybe want to grab some food or something ? mm hmm , sure"
"well , i i if it s just , um oh , uh fratboiphysicals"
"you know , it s not gonna be romantic as if i were back in high school and i don t need a big moment or anything but as silly as it sounds , i do want it to be special"
i just i don t know if i m ready for this
"look , i don t think anyone can ever know how or if they re ever gonna be ready"
kind of wish it was both of our first times cause i just don t know if i m gonna be any good at it
okay ? and if you feel like it s right then he will make you feel like you re the only one
"can i get you two lovebirds anything else ? uh , yeah"
or herpes simplex ? what ? he asked if we want a table or a booth
i think it would be better for our relationship if we agree not to have sex for the next seven to days
"do you know how much it means to me that you re even considering this ? i mean , i don t know if our relationship is forever but right now i know that nothing s ever felt as real to me as my love for you"
"and if there s a way for me to express how i feel about you whether it s buying you dinner or spending time with you or having sex , i i want to do it"
and i do believe that if we were to take that step that it would be incredible and special
"what d you tell her ? i said , yeah , if we don t kill each other in combat class , count us in"
"what happened in there ? you were really coming at me , as if you had something to prove"
"if you re calling to break up with me , just go ahead and say it and get it over with so we can figure out how we re gonna be friends"
"okay , my philosophy is that if you can t even say the word without spelling it then you re definitely not ready"
"if i decide to do it , i want it to be the making love version not the bumping uglies version"
"sam definitely loves you , because i don t know any other year old boy who would say it s okay to wait if he wasn t totally in love with you and obsessed with you"
"but it s easy to love when it s new , you know and if he can put up with my crazy and my sass for a couple more weeks or even a couple of months , who knows ? i salute you"
"it s like me and mercedes , you know ? if something s important , you can t let sex get in the way of it"
"if you need your cup filled , we ll fill it right here"
the ticket is yours if you want it
"and so is everybody else , except for a few moronic bloggers"
"so , you know , if i ever need any validation i just turn to my buffet of people right in front of me"
"if you don t mind , i am going to take a nap"
what if rachel needs my love and validation from the buffet ? just go
"if you want a pep talk , you should call mr"
who gives a crap what all the other peasants think ? i can t stand you of the time but even i know that if you drag your flat little ass out on that stage tonight you re gonna murder that crowd
ticket ! get your ticket ! you ladies have tickets ? one ticket for sale ! i got one ticket for sale if anybody needs it
and so if i can get through that then i ll be fine
"if you need a little boost , just zone in on us"
if he doesn t like it we re kaput
"if the review is bad , then opening night is closing night"
"seriously , if i wanted to see a show about an ugly duckling who gets dumped i d just watch an episode of girls"
"you know , that show would ve been a lot better if you d been up there on that stage"
and then when the reviews hit the stand we ll find out if we re the best thing since sliced bread or toast
"and if i were you , i d put something down on that couch before i sat on it"
but i really don t think that s what you wanted because if we actually felt how wonderful and amazing and loved we really were then we would know what you knew all along which is that you are a rotten and awful person who only finds joy in people s misery
but she also has something else in spades talent
but if you re anything like this champion cheerleading coach you just might also find love
"if we play our cards right , you could make a killing"
"we re getting married ! what ? if something exciting happens to one of us , it happens to the other one too"
"wait , what ? and you re just gonna listen to these morons ? if i don t get backed by the label , that means i won t get any promotion which means i don t get any airplay"
if we re lucky
"you know , maybe if your , you know , if your head came off or there was , uh , some kind of invasion of aliens in midtown manhattan maybe , maybe"
"if you don t get this track down this week , you re gonna lose your release date"
"and if you think about it , some of hollywood s greats were plucked from the stage"
"you mean , lie ? if someone came to you at nyada right now and asked you to audition for this tv show , tell me you would say no"
"that is why , blaine , if i m going to launch your career and make the world know who you are , we have to be friends"
"okay , look , if you re really into doing a duet let me make some phone calls"
and if everything goes like it s supposed to then we revisit this on your follow up album
"this is your big chance and it should be all about you , you know ? and i really appreciate what you tried to do for me here but i know what i would do if i was in your position"
"do you think my understudy , wendy , can do it ? well , if i have to , i have to"
so if you put out charisma to every person you meet the universe will see to it that it comes back to you
i would love it if we could have kurt in the show too
"well , do you have a better one ? because if rachel doesn t get back in time , she could get fired"
"um , i didn t want to alarm you , but i didn t know who else to call"
i guess i could quit again if you want to spend the next couple of hours handing out refunds
at least i m not going to be sued for all the tickets they would have had to refund if the show had been canceled
"i mean , that broadway stuff is fun if you only have to do it once"
"oh , okay , i m not gonna ask you anything else but i am i am dying to know what i ll be doing"
if you ever pull something like this again i will not only fire you i will sue you back to the stone age for breach of contract
"if there s one thing i know about , it s cultivating an image"
can i get you a menu ? i was wondering if your boss would mind putting up a poster
tell him if he decides not to i m going to accuse him of elder abuse
"and if you don t have any plans , and it would seem that you don t come and visit us in rehearsal"
i don t know if you ve seen it
"if you wear it and get photographed in it , you get to keep it for free"
"if it s that important to you , we will try it"
"seriously , you know , i could lose jobs if i don t clean this up"
"if i get down , i m not getting back up"
"you know , if you want to seem young , you gotta feel young"
before you say anything else you should know that artie and i tamed the beast that is mcconaughey
"and you know what else i ve been thinking about ? you going on tour , and me being in this brownstone all alone and wanting some company"
"but if we re being honest i think it s also about when i suggested we take mcconaughey home you couldn t even imagine me being able to take care of him , okay ? and that s just that s just crap , okay ? it s like you re looking at me like i m a boy and not a man"
but that s only gonna happen if you start taking me seriously
"so , what s the point of having a dog , even one as cute as mcconaughey if you can t take care of him , and you can t enjoy him ? you heard what they do to the pets that you bring back to those shelters , right ? well , then , you re gonna have to find a home for him"
"from the lexington home of retired performers , give it up and enjoy the song ! if he s not going home with us , we need to find the perfect home for mcconaughey"
"if not , sam , we ll just we ll figure something out but we re not gonna take him back to the shelter"
"my motto is , if i can make berry work , i can do anything"
because if i m gonna be out of town on this mall tour i m gonna need those rexy models you re working with to know that you have a girl
"that way , if i decide to freestyle i won t fall on my ass into the crowd"
"and if you have the first two , you don t have to worry about the third"
how am i supposed to believe you love me if i can t trust you ? i did it because i love you
i didn t know what else to do
too bad i can t believe anything else you say
"if you can t get into my jeans with your walk , then you don t have it"
"and if that makes me a romantic and not a realist well , that s the way that i m choosing to live my life"
"if you go out for that tv show , you re going to have to burn a lot of bridges"
sidney greene even said he s gonna blackball you if you missed another performance
"look , if i do this tv show , then i can , like , come back to new york afterwards and do any show i want for , like , times the amount of money"
"but if you re making that bet , i i wish you d bet on your voice not some crazy psychopath who eats couch cushions"
"if i m going to do this , it s gonna be my show , or no show at all"
"and millions of years of evolution are telling you that if you jump , you won t hit the ground like a stone you can never really know"
"you give someone your heart to look after and you tell yourself that you re safe , but you never know if today or tomorrow is gonna be the day that they drop it like a stone"
"if you re not mad at me , then where are you going with all this flying stuff ? oh , no , i i was mad"
"i don t know if it s all this bird talk , but i m getting a little turned on"
"what are you feeling ? um well , if i was a soup i would probably be minestrone"
"i m just worried that if i don t give you what you want , i i might lose it"
if i if i do decide to change my mind and not wait i ll give you a call
"if they do , go"
"so , um , kurt , would you like to sing this last duet with me ? oh if you all came here to get to know me tonight there s no better way than seeing me with my one true love"
you do realize that if i get this tv show it ll be the first time that we re apart in five years
"well , i think if we can get through that , our friendship can survive anything"
"if i ve learned anything this year , it s that you guys are my life"
"well , do you think that if we can get more people to watch the second episode if we were to do another episode , there would be protestors from unicef , the adl , the naacp , peta i mean , my blackberry is buzzing with angry e mails from nambla"
"what am i supposed to do with saltpeter ? well , if you sprinkle it on your kale , keep your sex drive down"
"yes , young man whose name i will never care to know , if there s one thing i am most proud of , it s the fact that i have proven , once and for all , young minds do not need the humanities or the arts"
"yeah , he he s a great guy , and if i learned wait , you haven t dated since you broke up , have you ? wow , you are psychic"
"bow bah , dah it s late in the evening glass on the side duh , duh , duh , duh , duh i ve been sat with you for most of the night duh , duh , duh , duh , duh ignoring everybody here we wish they would disappear duh , duh , duh , duh , duh so maybe we could get down now duh , duh , duh , duh , duh i don t want to know duh , duh , duh , duh , duh if you re getting ahead of the program i want you to be mine , lady duh , duh , duh , duh , duh to hold your body close take another step into the no man s land for the longest time , lady duh , duh , duh , duh , duh i need you , darling come on , set the tone if you feel you re falling won t you let me know oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh duh , duh , duh , duh , duh oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh duh , duh , duh , duh , duh oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh if you love me come on , get involved feel it rushing through you from your head to toe oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh duh , duh , duh , duh , duh oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh duh , duh , duh , duh , duh oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh sing oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh oh , oh , oh , oh , oh oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh oh , oh , oh , oh , oh can you feel it ? all they guys in here don t even want to dance can you feel it ? all that i can hear is music from the back can you feel it ? i found you hiding here so won t you take my hand , darling ? before the beat kicks in again can you feel it ? ooh oh oh can you feel it ? no , no , no , no oh , no if you love me , come on , get involved feel it rushing through you from your head to toe oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh oh , oh , oh , oh , oh oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh oh , oh , oh , oh , oh oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh oh , oh , oh , oh , oh sing ! oh , my god"
"come on ! if salmon had legs , we d have it for dinner , not breakfast ! okay , these guys are really good"
"what about the kids that don t play sports ? look , rachel , i agree with you , okay ? if you have a problem , just take it up with sue"
"well , how is someone else supposed to use it when you leave it like that ? living together is supposed to be a trial run , and i got to tell you , i think we are failing it"
"can t rely on my old tricks if i want to get us a win at sectionals , which means no waiting till the last minute , no mercedes to park and bark , and no journey"
what i need to know is if i m crazy for considering having the entire team do a synchronized backflip
"remember , my office door is always open if any of you have any problems , so , um am i dreaming ? is that star of stage and screen rachel berry ? i think the correct term is unhireable"
"i mean , there s always something else , especially for someone as talented as you are"
someone else lives here ? that s right
"right , but aren t you in charge of the principals ? even if i wanted to go over sue sylvester s head , and reinstate the glee club , it would be impossible at this point"
what if i gave the money ? i i have some left over from that s so rachel
"it s not much , but i d be willing to donate it if it meant bringing back the glee club"
i i would understand if you had told me to screw off
"um , if if if can you excuse me"
"what i m saying is , shouldn t we first find out if she can even sing ? hmm ? all those in favor ? aye"
"yeah ? well , you never would have thought to do your work study program here at mckinley if i wasn t here in the first place"
"okay , there is no point in organizing sheet music if we don t have any members"
"rachel , you ve got to get more proactive if you expect this to work"
"not all the time , but if you re not here , then the tradition of the club we love so much will be gone"
"and if i were you , i would do , like , to bars"
"the point that i m trying to make is that sometimes change is scary , even when it doesn t seem all that significant , and i m telling you , it would mean so much to me and and it could mean so much to the warblers if you d just if you could swallow your pride , come in and show us what you got"
"even if there s a hundred people out there , you have to make a personal connection"
"so , why aren t they here trying to recruit me ? why d they send you ? cause we both like guys ? look , i know we don t have much else in common , but only a gay man knows what it s like for us out there"
"but don t you think it s everyone else s thing ? when i told people i was gay , only two people had a problem with it"
"look , you re you re naive if you don t think you re standing on our shoulders"
"just because you and i happened to be born in the same ten percent of the population that would choose andrew garfield over emma stone , doesn t mean we have anything else in common"
what am i gonna tell my dad ? you are gonna tell him that we are not giving up on you because i am going straight to the dalton board of directors and telling them that i am not interested in coaching the warblers if you re not one of them
"and sometimes , if you want to make change , you you got to make a little noise"
"if you really want to get blaine back , here s what you do"
"and secondly , if you want to get rid of the glee club , you re gonna have to get better items than that"
"even if they let me on the warblers , i ll be fighting for every vocal breakout"
my parents are willing to let me transfer here if it s what i want
i wouldn t be surprised if you made this all happen after seeing you with dave
"if you build it , they will come"
"how do you call yourselves a sheet music store if you don t have the soundtrack of smash ? ugh , i know , it s like a show choir hate crime"
"or even off off broadway , if you know what i mean , right ? um , it s good to see you , kurt"
"why don t we use carole king s seminal break up album tapestry as this week s lesson ? yeah , it s brilliant , but , i mean , it s sort of a downer , don t you think ? if we re gonna do a break up album , then it has to be jagged little pill , cause it s modern and edgy and angry"
"i mean , if you asked me what my dream was , like , right now , besides like , having one of those , like , giant talking m m s and , uh , making it my pet it would probably be to take over your job when you retire"
"if it were up to me , i d give you a shot"
"right ? or , if you don t like reese s pieces , you could name another candy of your choice"
if for no other reason than to mess with berry and her sad gay
i would totally hate us if i didn t know us
"actually , becky , we need to go if we re gonna beat the rush"
"all i m saying is that if she did , sam evans could take over"
"look , becky , if you re too tired , just say so"
"sorry , becks , but we got to fly if we re gonna make our and you know they don t like to hold a table"
"i know , but i just feel like , if i start seeing someone else or just even go on a date , that i ll be admitting that it s over , and i i i don t want to do that"
"if you just hold them in your hand hoping that you might get to eat them one day , they re going to melt"
"but at some point , it might , and if we did have sex , i i don t see what s wrong with that"
"tonight you re mine completely you give your love so sweetly tonight the light of love is in your eyes but will you love me tomorrow ? hey , yeah oh , oh oh oh , oh i had no choice but to hear you you stated your case time and again i thought about it you ve already won me over in spite of me and don t be alarmed if i fall head over feet and don t be surprised if i love you for all that you are yeah will you still love me tomorrow ? yeah tonight with words with words unspoken oh , oh oh oh when the night when the night meets he morn meets the morn ing sun you ve already won me over in spite of me and don t be alarmed if i fall head over feet and don t be surprised if i love you for all that you are all that you are will you still love me tomorrow ? you ve already won me over will you still love me tomorrow ? yeah , yeah"
"so far away doesn t anybody stay in one place anymore ? it would be so fine to see your face at my door doesn t help to know you re just time away long ago i reached for you and there you stood holding you again could only do me good how i wish i could but you re so far away one more song about moving along the highway i can t say much of anything that s new if i could only work this life out my way well , you really can t blame her for not joining in"
"sue also told us to be honest with you and treat you like we would treat anyone else , so let s just say it"
"if we re going to do this , we want to be champions"
and that s not going to happen if you go easy on us
"we didn t work hard enough on our number , and we re going to need someone like kurt being brutally honest with us if we want to be the best"
"do do , do do do do , do mm i recommend do do getting your heart trampled on to anyone do do do do , do do yeah mm , i do do recommend walking around naked in your living room do do do , do yeah close your eyes and think of me and soon i will be there to brighten up even your darkest night oh , yeah , yeah you live , you learn you love , you learn you cry , you learn you lose , you learn winter , spring , summer or fall you breathe , you learn you scream , you learn and i ll be there all you have to do is call you ve got a friend ain t it good to know that you ve got a friend you love , you learn when people can be so cold ? you cry , you learn they ll hurt you , yes , and desert you and take your soul if you let them if you let them oh , but don t you let them oh , yeah , yeah you just call out my name you live , you learn you love , you learn you laugh , you learn you choose , you learn oh , yes , i will you ve got a friend you learn oh , yes , i will you ve got a friend it s good to know ain t it good to know you ve got a friend you ve got a friend it s good to know you ve got a friend"
"if they see you guys killing these numbers you ve had all summer to perfect , well , then they re gonna lose any sliver of hope they have , and the glee club ll be dead here"
and i m not gonna get that if you crush all of their hopes at this invitational
"the warblers are being rebuilt , just like the new directions ! i m sorry , but my allegiance is with them , and if that at all seems scary to you guys , then you should probably drop out"
"if i were on a deserted island with everybody i knew , i would absolutely eat you first"
"but what about your fabulous , over the top gay wedding ? ! i already told becky she could be the celebrant ! when else am i ever gonna get to provincetown ? ! wow , that s intimidating"
"oh , becky , if you just said i am one bad ass , crazy super bitch , you are correct"
"you positively worship a student if they can so much as carry a tune , and yet you don t know a single name of the only true musical geniuses in that choir room the band ! who have demonstrated , time and again , that they can , at the drop of a hat , play literally any song you can name , and still , you treat them like so much nameless human garbage"
"cause you know what ? if you re lucky , that sphincter just might toot out the first minute and a half of wheel in the sky , which is the only journey song you haven t yet managed to ruin"
"why can t she , and everyone else , just understand that , yes , you were my first love and you were mine"
"making my way downtown , walking fast faces passing , i m home bound staring blankly ahead just making my way , making my way through the crowd and i need you and i miss you and now i wonder if i could fall into the sky do you think time would pass me by cause you know i d walk a thousand miles if i could just see you tonight yeah , tonight yeah , tonight oh , tonight ! and i , i don t want to let you know i , i drown in your memory i , i don t want to let this go i , i don t if i could fall into the sky do you think time would pass us by ? cause you know i d walk a thousand miles if i could just see you oh ! if i could fall into the sky into the sky do you think time would pass us by ? cause you know i d walk a thousand miles if i could just see you if i could just hold you tonight"
"can i just talk to your coach for a second ? okay , so i m just gonna say this , because i haven t been able to think about anything else , and i got , like , zero sleep last night , but our kiss ? what kiss ? what kiss ? exactly , right , we re both creative people , and sometimes creative people create bonds with their fellow actors , and sometimes those bonds create gestures that don t necessarily mean the same thing in the real world as they would in show business"
"well , how about this ? what if you and i just started out as friends ? no expectations whatsoever"
"we take it really slow , and if either one of us gets uncomfortable , we call it a day"
"she said that , you know , if you stopped paying them , that maybe you would get all distracted with , like , collection agencies and stop focusing on work , which would give her an advantage on vocal adrenaline"
"well , hey , look , if you run into her , could you please just do me a favor and tell her that i stole your bills , because she asked me to come at night , and then there s this whole a"
"even if one show choir s co director is kidnapped and held against his will , causing him to miss the performance"
but i can t tell if he thinks this is a date or if we re just friends
"well , that s because their chemistry is so intense , becky , if they were actually to make eye contact oh , my the emotion would be such they d have to disappear behind the nearest dumpster and just hump , hump , hump , hump , hump"
"but i got that last one from artie , so are you trying to pick me up ? because if you re gonna go lezzy with a cheerleader , i think the world s kind of rooting for you and quinn fabray"
"ladies and lady boys , i give you the dalton academy warblers ! my sharona my sharona ooh , my little pretty one a pretty one when you gonna give me some time , sharona ? ooh , you make my motor run , my motor run gun it , coming off of the line , sharona never gonna stop , give it up such a dirty mind , always get it up for the touch of the younger kind my , my , my , yi , yi whoo ! ooh my sharona whoo ! you spin me right round baby , right round like a record , baby right round , round , round if i i get to know your name well , i could trace your private number , baby all i know is that to me you look like you re having fun open up your loving arms watch out , here i come you spin me right round , baby , right round like a record , baby right round , round , round i want your love all i know is that to me you look like you re lots of fun open up your loving arms watch out , here i come you spin me right round , baby , right round like a record , baby , right round i need your love you spin me right round baby , right round like a record , baby right round , right round"
"well , can you help me find kurt ? and , oh , if you really want to get in my good graces , then you can help me find seven new members for the glee club"
"if you don t find a way out , you ll be forced to eat each other and then suffocate"
"if you kiss each other , you will be allowed to leave this room"
i can t decide if that s sad or adorable
"it s just that sue is judging , and if she wasn t , then i d have it , but i know she s gonna hate anything that i pick"
"i got to be tougher , stronger and more manly than everyone else on the team because if they smell even a little bit of gay on me , i m not their teammate anymore"
"if i join the glee club , everything i worked so hard for , it s ruined"
"you re probably worried about them , but i wouldn t if i were you , because ten to one , they ve eloped to new york where they belong"
i wouldn t be the least bit surprised if he kidnapped them
"so if you guys want to quit , now is the time"
you ll probably have an easier experience at this school if you do
"but if you don t want to , then we ll just stay here and and we ll work super hard and put our noses to the grindstone and we might even have to pull an all nighter"
"and we said that if we ever had a celebrity child , this is what we would name it"
"if if i was an ironic rapper , this would be my name"
"like , he a little too much , if you ask me"
"just know that if you choose to resist , you choose to die"
"so when you remember the ones who have lied who said that they cared but then laughed as you cried beautiful darling don t think of me because all i ever wanted i will be your father figure put your tiny hand in mine i will be your preacher , teacher anything you have in mind , baby i will be your father figure i have had enough of crimes i will be the one who loves you till the end of time i will be your father i will be your i will be your preacher father i will be your father i ll be your daddy i will be the one who loves you till the end of time i m lying alone with my head on the phone thinking of you till it hurts i know you hurt , too but what else can we do ? tormented and torn apart i wish i could carry your smile in my heart for times when my life seems so low it would make me believe what tomorrow could bring when today doesn t really know doesn t really know i m all out of love i m so lost without you i know you were right believing for so long i m all out of love what am i without you ? i can t be too late to say that i was so wrong what what are you thinking of ? la , la , what are you thinking of i m all out of love i m so lost without you i know you were right believing for so long i m all out of love what am i without you ? i can t be too late to say that i was so wrong whoa yes , yes , yes , yes , yes"
"and if you ever litter at my school again and expect me to clean it up , you sorry excuse for a stain on a dead tramp s lacy panties , i swear to sweet holy satan , i will end you"
"shh , if you re gonna say things like that to me , you need to use your psychic inside voice"
"but there s , like , a huge part of me that has a bigger thing for mercedes , so i look , i d be lying if i didn t say that i have feelings for you , too"
"i mean , why ? what did what did you hear ? if the olympics had a gossip event , kurt hummel would be mark spitz"
"and i can tell you that nothing feels right if rachel berry isn t in front of an audience somewhere , killing it six nights a week and twice on sunday"
"uh , i think i would have remembered if i dated a guy with glasses , okay ? i have a question"
"wishin and hopin and thinkin and prayin plannin and dreamin each night of her charms that won t get you into her arms so if you re lookin to find love you can share all you got to do is hold her and kiss her and love her and show her that you care show her that you care just for her do the things she likes to do wear your hair just for her cause you won t get her thinkin and a prayin wishin and a hopin cause wishin and hopin and thinkin and prayin plannin and dreamin the kisses will start that won t get you into her heart ah ooh so if you re thinkin about how great true love is all you gotta do is hold her and kiss her and squeeze her and love her yeah , just do it , and after you do you will be hers you will be hers you will be hers i think heaven may be the perfect theme for this wedding"
"i m sorry if that s awkward for you , kurt"

"uh , what agency ? uh , you know , is it okay if i just , like , go ahead and set up inside ? uh yeah"
"and , if there s time , stephen hawking"
"ah ! if you do that , i ll skin you alive"
"once in your life you ll find her someone who turns your heart around and next thing you know you re closing down the town wake up and it s still with you even though you left her way across town you re wondering to yourself hey , what have i found ? when you get caught between the moon and new york city i know it s crazy but it s true if you get caught between the moon and new york city the best that you can do the best that you can do is fall in love arthur , he does as he pleases all of his life , his master s toys and deep in his heart he s just he s just a boy living his life one day at a time he s showing himself a really good time he s laughing about the way they want him to be when you get caught between the moon and new york city i know it s crazy but it s true ah ah if you get caught between the moon and new york city the best that you can do the best that you can do the best that you can do is fall in love"
"i mean , if abuela gets to know us and sees that we re somewhat normal , like how i sometimes dance in my sleep and how you sometimes dye your hair blonde for no reason , then she ll see us for who we really are , okay ? and then maybe she ll understand that , um , aside from the awesome lesbian sex part , that we re we re just like everybody else"
"you know , like , two minutes ago , it was cool if i touched your boobs , but then we break up , and then it s not , and then but you ve been dating people , right ? i mean , you re going out with girls , i assumed , and you just weren t telling me"
"actually , i thought that if i did , it would hurt you and we wouldn t be friends anymore"
"and yes , if it makes you feel any better , i am a little bit jealous"
"promises , promises i m all through with promises promises now i don t know how i got the nerve to walk out if i shout remember i feel free now i can look at myself and be proud i m laughing out loud oh , promises , promises this is where those promises , promises end i don t pretend that what was wrong can be right every night i sleep now no more lies things that i promised myself fell apart but i found my heart oh , promises , their kind of promises can just destroy a life oh , promises , those kind of promises take all the joy from life oh , promises , promises my kind of promises can lead to joy and hope and love yes love love what are we doing here ? uh , does your fianca e work here ? no"
"what s it all about ? alfie is it just for the moment we live ? what s it all about when you sort it out , alfie ? are we meant to take more than we give or are we meant to be kind ? and if only fools are kind alfie then i guess it is wise to be cruel and if life belongs only to the strong , alfie what will you lend on an old golden rule ? as sure as i believe there s a heaven above alfie ah i know there s something much more something even unbelievers can believe in alfie alfie alfie hi , abuela"

"look , sue has just been such a big part of our lives , right ? i mean , we only met because she put us in the cheerios ! all i have to say is if you invite the woman to the wedding , there is an chance that she s gonna ruin it"
"but if you don t , there s a chance that she will"
"if she s there , then i m not"

"if you remember , i got kicked out of nyada , too"
if i deem you worthy of crushing the new directions ! with a national championship you will be guaranteed under my tutelage
"save me , darling i am down , but i am far from over give me something i need it all , cause i am running over you think this is hard ? try taking down a gazelle with your bare hands ! that s hard ! we re only halfway there ! da , da da da , da da , da , da , da , da i am now pushing you harder than the level at which i was previously pushing you ! that doesn t look hard at all ! just passing the ball back and forth ? sit up straight and engage those abs ! save me , darling i am down , but i am far from over give me something i need it all cause i am running over hey , ladies , good luck with menopause if this is how fit you are at the peak of your physicality ! you should be ashamed of yourselves ! all right , everyone , take five"
"if this is gonna give them a little bit of comfort , then it s the least we could do"
i m back in nyada if i want to be
"like what ? what s wrong with this ? this is what i wanted ! no , what you wanted was a second chance to get it right , and carmen just gave that to you , okay ? if you throw all that away , you re gonna be making the same mistakes all over again"
"and i know i ve said that before , too ! betray you ? okay , everyone else betrayed you , sue"
"rachel berry , uncle bob just told me devastating news ! the bottom line is if new directions doesn t win , not only will the glee club get the ax , but all arts and music programs will be wiped from the school"
"well , if only we could just agree on costumes to wear for the most important competition of our lives"
"have you ever felt like you woke up on the wrong side of your heart ? has it ever felt like it s broken like the world tore it apart ? have you felt so weak you could hardly stand ? like if you ever fell , you could never tell if you d ever get back up again i know it s hard to do but i think you can make it cause i know we can take it baby , we will rise we are young , we are the dreamers we will fly when the world will not believe us we will rise above the ashes before this whole life passes us by you and i we will rise la , la , la , la la , la , la , la oh , we will we will rise we are young , we are the dreamers we will fly when the world will not believe us we will rise above the ashes before this whole life passes us by you and i we will rise yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah we will rise we will rise we will rise above the ashes before this whole life passes us by oh , yeah you and i , we will rise !"
"dalton academy burnt down , and all the warblers came to mckinley , which is good because the new directions ! didn t have enough kids , and if they don t win , the glee club s over , but it might be anyway because rachel got accepted back at nyada and got offered a role on broadway"
"may i remind you that if we don t win sectionals , glee club no longer exists"
"if oprah can do this , so can you"
how the hell are we supposed to get this routine down if i can t even get through my day without tripping over myself ? we re screwed
"i mean , how are we supposed to get through this routine if neither one of us actually even knows it ? i mean , we need someone to help us"
"just please , think about the future , okay ? and not just , like , the next month or the next big ticket out of here , but actually look back at yourself from the future and ask if dropping out of nyada was something you re proud of"
"i know there s something in the wake of your smile i get a notion from the look in your eyes yeah you built a love but that love falls apart your little piece of heaven turns to dark listen to your heart when he s calling for you listen to your heart there s nothing else you can do i don t know where you re going and i don t know why but listen to your heart before you tell him good bye oh , oh oh listen to your heart when he s calling for you listen to your heart listen to your heart there s nothing else you can do i don t know where you re going and i don t know why but listen to your heart listen to your heart before oh listen to your heart listen to your heart take a listen to it , whoa i don t know where you re going and i don t know why but listen to your heart before you tell him good bye"
i just don t know yet if it s gonna be for college or for broadway
"so now i have the chance to rectify that mistake by going back to college , so what if that s the right choice ? rachel , your mistake was not leaving nyada"
"the only way you could put weight on that thing , let alone dance , is if you got a cortisone shot"
"if you perform on an ankle like that , there s no telling how much worse it ll get"
"what if i say no to the show , and then i never get cast on broadway again ? it could be like career suicide"
"if you ll be so kind , i d like to get my signature carol brady blowout before i lead vocal adrenaline to sectionals"
"if history has taught us anything , it s that this school is remarkably easy to break into"
"you know , sue , it was will and i who stood up for you when nobody else would"
"i don t know if you ve found an apartment yet to live in , in new york , but , uh , you can always stay at mine until you find one"
"well , if you ever need anything , my door is always open"
"because i don t know if you ve heard the good news , but the glee club is starting up again"
i guess i just feel safer if i let all the clothes do the talking
"i could be a big , big star if i weren t so shy"
"almost everyone else around here looks at me like i have terminal cancer and can somehow spread it through my wheelchair , but tina doesn t look at the chair"
"see if you can top that , wheels"
"i m just a bachelor i m looking for a partner someone who knows how to ride without even falling off gotta be compatible takes me to my limits ooh , girl , when i break you off i promise that you won t want to get off if you want it let s do it ride it , my pony my saddle s waiting come and jump on it if you want it let s do it ride it , my pony my saddle s waiting come and jump on it yeah"
you and everyone else are gonna have plenty of opportunities for a solo we ll all take turns
"saigon or black dorothy from the wiz , but if we want to be taken seriously as a glee club , then it can t be about color or disability or whatever"
even if they get something that you want
what if you end up spending so much time with the glee kids that you start neglecting our time together ? i don t want to become one of those ignored wives who has an affair
"but i was actually headed to the locker room to see if , uh , any of the football players signed up"
i think it would make an important statement to the rest of the team if you told them right at the beginning that i m the star
"i am proud to say that i have grown numb to the cruelty , but none of it is going to happen if there s no glee club"
"if i want him to give up on this stupid accounting thing , i have to go talk directly to his boss"
"and even sooner , if you keep stressing me out by complaining that you can t do my job right now"
"but isn t the point of life to imagine yourself doing something greater , then working hard to achieve all of your dreams ? yes , if it s realistic"
but not if i m gonna let will ruin it by chasing after a dream that doesn t change our lives in any measurable way
"oh , by the way , if you need help with that , i m more than happy to pitch in"
"and if we start excluding people , then we re no different than the people who exclude us"
"please , please , if if there s anything i can do to help , just just let me know"
"okay ? that is not an appetizer , all right ? now that you re the principal , you have to set a good nutritional example for the other teachers i don t know if i can live up to that standard"
"and be in love , right ? because if we don t like something now , we can you know , we can fix it"
"and if i ve learned one thing , it s the message in the lyrics of this song"
"you who are on the road must have a code that you can live by and so become yourself because the past is just a good bye teach your children well their father s hell will slowly go by and feed them on your dreams the one they picks the one you ll know by don t you ever ask them why if they told you , you would cry so just look at them and sigh and know they love you you of tender years can t know the fears that your elders grew by and so please help them with your youth they seek the truth before they can die teach your parents well their children s hell will slowly go by and feed them on your dreams the one they picks the one you ll know by don t you ever ask them why if they told you , you would cry so just look at them and sigh and know they love you"
i need to be able to just go out on the weekends and just shoot stuff if i want to
"now , if we want to be great , we need to be able to sing about hurt and loss"
"and even if we can t relate to the specifics , make them our own"
"no , no , no , no , do not come up here , because that is not even the hard part , and if you come up here now , i am gonna lose it , and i am determined to walk out of here with some class"
"if it hadn t been for you , we would still be apart , and we would still be miserable"
"with your hippo broaches and your knee length sweaters , standing there all sassy with your arms crossed and your hips all cocked out , and your eyes rolled back as if to say , oh , how droll"
"and now , if you ll excuse me , there s somebody i need to see"
"you wanted to see me ? uh , what s what s going on ? i don t wanna talk about things we ve gone through nothing more to say no more ace to play the winner takes it all the loser s standing small beside the victory that s her destiny but tell me , does she kiss like i used to kiss you ? does it feel the same when she calls your name ? butt chin the game is on again a lover or a friend a big thing or a small the winner takes it all i don t wanna talk if it makes you feel sad and i understand you ve come to shake my hand the winner takes it all the winner takes it all the winner takes it all the winner takes it all the winner takes it all the loser has to fall the winner takes it all ! look , i know why you want brad ! snipers stand down"
"and now , without further ado , it is my pleasure to introduce the new directions ! bah , bah , bah , bah hope you take that jump bah , bah you don t fear the fall bah , bah bah , bah , bah , bah hope when the water rises bah , bah you built a wall bah , bah bah , bah , bah , bah hope when crowd screams out bah , bah , bah they re screaming your name bah , bah , bah bah , bah hope if everybody runs you choose to stay bah , bah , bah , bah i hope that you fall in love bah bah , bah bah and it hurts so bad bah , bah yeah ah ah bah oh bah , bah the only way you can know , you give it all you have hey , yeah bah bah , bah bah and i hope that you don t suffer bah bah , bah bah but take the pain bah bah , bah bah , bah bah bah bah , bah bah , bah hope when the moment comes you ll say i , i , i i did it all i , i , i i did it all i owned every second that this world could give i saw so many places , the things that i did with every broken bone i swear i lived oh yeah oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh , oh , oh oh oh oh hey ey ey with every broken bone i lived i , i , i i did it all i , i , i i did it all i did it all , yeah i owned every second that this world could give this world could give i saw so many places , the things that i did yeah , with every broken bone i swear i lived oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh oh , yeah ah ah ah ah oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh i swear i lived oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh mm , mm mm oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh mm , mm mm mm , mm mm oh , oh oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh ! mm , mm mm mm mm"
if i don t catch you first
if you can get word to my family tell them i m no coward
king of the andals and the first men father will know if you do
"and if they die , you will bury them yourselves"
what if jon arryn told someone ? but who would he tell ? my husband
"if he told the king , both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now"
i wonder if the old gods agree
if he s coming this far north there s only one thing he s after
"if your sister had lived , we d have been bound by blood"
"did he like her ? trust me , your grace , if he didn t like her , we d know"
my apologies if i ve given offense
"i would let his whole tribe fuck you , all , men and their horses too , if that s what it took"
do you think joffrey will like me ? what if he thinks i m ugly ? then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived
jon father will let me if you ask him
"you might , if you knew what it meant"
"i m sure we ll have a tournament to celebrate your new title , if you accept"
lsn t there anything else ? the dothraki have two things in abundance grass and horses
"even if the boy lives , he ll be a cripple , a grotesque"
and if not it s only for life
"lt won t hack a man s head off , but it can poke him full of holes if you re quick enough"
"we can go out walking beyond the wall , if you re not afraid"
none of us knew if we were gonna go back home again
"l swear if l weren t your king , you d have hit me already"
"and if by chance he does , we ll throw him back into the sea"
what if he s wrong ? bran needs me
"l m sorry if l offended you , ser"
"if you d like to change into something more appropriate thank the gods you re here , stark"
"is that what you tell yourself at night ? you re a servant of justice ? that you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in aerys targaryen s back ? tell me , if i d stabbed the mad king in the belly instead of the back , would you admire me more ? you served him well when serving was safe"
"if you don t like her , you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes , to make little princes and princesses"
"and if you d rather fuck painted whores , you ll fuck painted whores"
"and if you d rather lie with noble virgins , so be it"
and if the northerners rebel ? i d crush them
"you re a liar , and if you told the truth , mycah would be alive"
"if you re going to own a sword , you d better know how to use it"
"if that were a real sword , you d be dead"
"if we threw you over the wall , i wonder how long it would take you to hit"
i wonder if they d find you before the wolves did
then what are you raving about ? what if it comes back to him ? if he tells his father what he saw we ll say he was lying
and my husband ? i ll go to war with him if i have to
"and if he does , i ll kill him"
and if you find the proof ? then i bring it to robert and hope he s still the man i once knew
"if that s all , your grace do the dothraki buy their slaves ? the dothraki don t believe in money"
"from whom ? if you rule a city and you see the horde approaching , you have two choices pay tribute or fight"
"do you hear me ? rakharo ask if you want him dead , khaleesi"
"really ? if i was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company , i d go mad"
"couldn t resist some northern arse ? if you like redheads , ask for ros"
"tell me , how do you think balon greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey ? i still remember seeing my father s fleet burn in lannisport"
you can call me sam if you want
"if my brother was given an army of dothraki , could you conquer the seven kingdoms ? the dothraki have never crossed the narrow sea"
"but if they did ? king robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle , but the men advising him are different"
"and wherever they are , just a few flaps of their wings and they re somewhere else far away"
"what if i have a girl ? gods be good , you ll have boys and girls and plenty of them"
what if i only have girls ? i wouldn t worry about that
"but what if ? well , if you only had girls , i suppose the throne would pass to prince joffrey s little brother"
"if you can t keep the king s peace , perhaps the city watch should be commanded by someone who can"
"now if there s nothing else , my lords ? oh , this heat"
and you re quite certain he died of a natural illness ? what else could it be ? poison
you re afraid of heights and almost everything else probably
"if you do not , he said , then we ll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you ll be thrown from your saddle to die"
"boy , this is the king s hand ! if his lordship wants the helmet i made it for me"
"what kind of questions ? about my work at first , if i was being treated well , if i liked it here"
"if the day ever comes when that boy would rather wield a sword than forge one , you send him to me"
"but if thorne puts me up against lady piggy , i m gonna slice me off a side of bacon"
i don t know if she s living or dead
i don t know if she s a noblewoman or a fisherman s wife or a whore
"because all i could think was what if i got her pregnant and she had a child , another bastard named snow ? it s not a good life for a child"
"if you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss , you lost a finger to the frost"
he couldn t lead an army even if my husband gave him one
"if the hound so much as heard you mention it , i m afraid all the knights in king s landing would not be able to save you"
"if the king got what he wanted all the time , he d still be fighting a damned rebellion"
at least i can smell someone else s blood
"if i die , what s the point ? ah ! rodrik ? i ll be fine , my lady"
i m willing if she is
how can she protect the family if she s not with her family ? your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept
"if the saddle lord tyrion designed actually works , you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback"
your father rebelled against king robert and if he does it again my father fought for the freedom of his people
"may i ? if the wrong ears heard what i m about to tell you , off comes my head"
if ser hugh poisoned him who paid ser hugh ? someone who could afford it
"if one hand can die , why not a second ? this hand is not the other"
if the lannisters were behind the attempt on the stark boy s life and it was discovered that you helped the starks come to that conclusion to think a simple word to the queen one shudders at the thought
"so you can imagine my burden , wondering if the king might question my friend s sympathies"
"and if you lay a hand on me , my father will have both your heads on spikes"
"your name , friend ? yoren , if it please"
"i m here to find men for the wall , see if there s any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service"
you will dishonor yourself forever if you do this
we commit murder on the word of this man ? and if he s right ? if she has a son ? a targaryen at the head of a dothraki army what then ? the narrow sea still lies between us
"what can i do for you ? when do you return to winterfell ? why ? what do you care ? if you re still here come nightfall , i ll take you to see the last person jon arryn spoke with before falling ill"
if that sort of thing still interests you
"if any harm comes to me , my brother jaime will see that they do"
are you sure this won t hurt ? only if i slip
"if you want hairless , maybe you should find a little boy"
he treats me as if i m a spoilt child
his eye was dangling out of the damn socket ! he shouldn t have entered the melee if he didn t know how to fight
"if you become king , you re going to see a lot of this"
but i do know this if the targaryen girl convinces her horselord husband to invade and the dothraki horde crosses the narrow sea we won t be able to stop them
"i thought if i didn t talk about her , she d just fade away for you"
"if it please you , tell him how beautiful she is"
"he just wanted to know if the child was happy , healthy"
"how many ? does it matter ? if you fuck enough women , some of them will give you presents"
if we don t act there will be a war
"this is what matters i can t rule the kingdoms if the starks and the lannisters are at each other s throats , so enough"
"and if you ever take it off again , i swear to the mother i ll pin the damned thing on jaime lannister"
"if you don t let me be , i ll have you all killed ! cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth"
have you lost your mind ? what if you d missed ? he would have killed you and cut bran s throat
if you are with your trouble when fighting happens more trouble for you
"how can you be quick as a snake or as quiet as a shadow when you are somewhere else ? you are fearing for your father , hmm ? that is right"
"if i sell one egg , i ll have enough to buy a ship"
"if you deliver a message from me to lady arryn , i will be in your debt"
"if you deliver the message and i live , which i very much intend to do"
"if i close my eyes , i can still see her tits bouncing"
"is this how justice is done in the vale ? you accuse me of crimes , i deny them , so you throw me into a cell to freeze and starve ? where is the king s justice ? i am accused and demand a trial ! if you re tried and found guilty , then by the king s own laws you will pay with your life"
if you were drunk enough and had some poor riverlands whore to shove your prick inside and make the eight
"when they was done , they butchered them as if they was animals"
"can you think of any reason the lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife ? if the lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king s protection , it would be that would be almost as brazen as attacking the hand of the king in the streets of the capital"
"and what will happen to me if i stay here ? will i become lady greyjoy , mistress of the iron islands ? don t be a fool"
"if another house can seize one of our own and hold him captive with impunity , we are no longer a house to be feared"
"where i come from , if someone like you attacked a little lord at low tide we d lay you on your back on the beach , your hands and feet chained to four stakes"
"what s that got to do with you ? if your father s lord , how can you be lord too ? i will be lord after my father"
you ask em if i didn t
"stop it , if it s not too late"
"who knows what really happened ? now if you ll pardon me , i ll seek out the merchant captain , see if he has any letters for me"
"and keep a fire burning in his chambers , change his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the lord commander requires of you"
"alone , if you will"
and i don t have to go with you if i don t want
"i would save the rest , if i were you"
"if that s true , then slit my throat and be done with it"
"if they d been dead for a long time , wouldn t there be rot ? we should burn them"
"if you would help your father , urge your brother to keep the king s peace"
"if if i could see my father , talk to him about you disappoint me , child"
if you should refuse to obey i won t refuse
but if you re asking me to send men from the vale to fight that is what i ask
if you fear for the safety of your son of course i fear for the safety of my son ! are you an idiot ? they killed my husband
"if i m going to die , it may as well be with a song in my heart"
"and if the day ever comes when you re tempted to sell me out , remember this whatever their price , i ll beat it"
"if you see us through these mountains , my father will shower you with gold"
"what do the stone crows do ? hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the vale ride by ? are those the best weapons you could steal ? good enough for killing sheep , if the sheep don t fight back"
"but if you help us , shagga , son of dolf , i will not give you trinkets"
"if her wailing offends the khaleesi , i will bring you her tongue"
"if your riders would mount them , let them take them for wives"
"mago , find somewhere else to stick your cock"
"i ll send letters whenever i can , but if you don t hear from me , don t be scared"
"who do you think sends the wind if not the gods ? they see you , boy"
what else did the book say ? the white walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years
"if you think you can send me back to winterfell oh , would that i could"
you can take the twins if you have to
"do l look dead to you ? father , please l need lessons in courtesy from you , bastard ? your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadn t squirted you into her belly"
"and l swore oaths to the crown too , if l remember right"
l wouldn t be standing here if it wasn t for you and your beast
and ? one was do you consent ? can l refuse ? not if you want to cross
who told you this ? women you paid ? and three more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years
"doth even if even if he dies why would l run ? l am khaleesi , and my my son will be khal after drogo"
does it involve the potential for losing fingers ? not if you win
l ll know if you re lying
"my dear lady , if l have offended you , l apologize"
did we win ? we wouldn t be having this conversation if we didn t
you slip out of that gown and we ll see if l m up to it
"why cry about it ? because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells , if the gods are just"
what gods are those ? the trees your husband prayed to ? where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off ? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice ? because of men like you
"you will bring that boy king to heel , and his mother too , if needs be"
"and if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest baelish , varys , pycelle heads , spikes , walls"
they ll kill you if they find out you ve gone
they ll kill you if they know you came after me
"do you remember our first ride , my sun and stars ? lf you are in there , if you haven t gone away , show me"
"they say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down , he can often be blind to the enemies at his side"
"and what would you do , my friend , if you found yourself sitting up there ? l must be one of the few men in this city who doesn t want to be king"
"the night s watch will ride in force against the wildlings , the white walkers and whatever else is out there"
"khaleesi , my queen l vow to serve you , obey you , to die for you if need be but let him go , khaleesi"
"go if you wish , no one will stop you"
"but if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters , as husbands and wives"
"if it lasts any longer , we ll have fewer peasants"
"if i were capable of tricking father , i d be emperor of the world by now"
"and if the king listens to what i say , the king might just get his uncle jaime back"
"and you re sure there s no other way ? if we go south to the land of the lhazareen , the lamb men will kill us and take your dragons"
"if we go west to the dothraki sea , the first khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons"
i d keep on not seeing them if i were you
"we follow where he leads , even if we don t like the path"
if you tell him the truth what s the truth ? and i declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved brother robert he wasn t my beloved brother
"whatever else he is , the man s still a knight"
"if , for the time being , you could make peace with your brother i ll not make peace with renly while he calls himself king"
"i m sure he doesn t , but we do if we re going to war"
"if not renly , your grace , join forces with robb stark"
"if i left you with one of my bannermen , your father would know within a fortnight and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message , release my son and you ll be rich beyond your dreams"
"if that s true , stannis is the rightful king"
as if the poor man didn t suffer enough
i wonder if i might ask you for a favor
"if she s escaped the capital , winterfell seems the logical destination"
"if we choose to negotiate with the starks , the girl has some value"
do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the stark girl for me
i offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms
"if he disregards this command , he shall suffer the same fate as my father , only i don t need a servant to do my beheading for me"
"if the queen regent and her son meet them , i ll give them peace"
"if not , i will litter the south with lannister dead"
"if i trade the kingslayer for two girls , my bannermen will string me up by my feet"
"what are we fighting for , if not for them ? it s more complicated than that ! you know it is"
"you have a hundred other lords which of these lords do i trust more than you ? if renly sides with us , we ll outnumber them two to one"
"but if not , we need her"
"i m sure if you asked grandfather the king does not ask , he commands"
father had other children ? besides me and tommen and myrcella ? what are you asking ? i m asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you
i could shave a spider s arse if i wanted to
"if you speak with him , tell him he s not been forgotten"
if that s everything a raven flew in this morning from castle black
"and i said , if the gods wanted us to have dignity , they wouldn t make us fart when we died"
i can still run if i have to
"if it s a boy if it s a boy , what ? you want us to risk our lives for you and you won t even tell us why ? why d you do that ? do what ? ask her a question ? you were cruel"
"and even if he would , what would we do with her ? who s going to deliver a baby , you ? i could try"
"no , but who else would want to murder king robert s bastards ? she s always been a jealous woman"
"if you think i ll stand here and take this from you , dwarf dwarf ? you should have stopped at imp"
"if i told you to murder an infant girl , say , still at her mother s breast , would you do it without question ? without question ? no"
"i d ask , how much ? if they come back , i say we yield"
"if you got within a mile of a battle , you d fill your pants"
"so ? so , if they ve got armor on , it s a battle"
your blood will be in the sea if i don t watch where i m going
you may get to stay in a castle tonight if you re lucky
"who gave you those clothes ? was it ned stark s pleasure to make you his daughter ? if my clothes offend you , i will change them"
who else ? i told you to wait outside
"and correct me if i m wrong , most pirates don t grow old"
"and if we don t drown at the bottom of blackwater bay , i will fuck this blonde queen and i ll fuck her well"
as if she would just let you
"well , if he does his job , he ll have his share"
"if it is within my power , it is yours"
"and if i did , i would not share his strategies with you"
"if robb stark wants a pact with us , he should come himself , not hide behind his mother s skirts"
"if you ll follow me , my lady"
die for him if i must
"and , if it please you , brienne s enough"
i just wonder if it s not wiser to wait
why risk going against the north if they would be our allies ? rise up against them and they could destroy us
"but if we pledge fealty to them , they ll give us casterly rock"
you act as if i volunteered to go
"you gave me away , if you remember"
"even if he does , sansa will do her duty"
"and you offer her son a princess ? for men in our position , holding grudges can be an encumbrance , don t you think ? and i suppose you want me to broker this agreement ? who better ? yes , i could sing this song to lysa , if i cared to"
what ? what is it ? a member of the kingsguard ? as if i wasn t humiliated enough already
"you decide how you want to do it , with me , with me and loras , however else you like"
"no ! just how safe do you think myrcella is if this city falls ? do you want to see her raped , butchered like the targaryen children ? make no mistake"
"if myrcella marries the martell boy , she can t very well marry robin arryn , can she ? no , afraid not"
"but if it s swordsmen who rule , why do we pretend kings hold all the power ? when ned stark lost his head , who was truly responsible ? joffrey ? the executioner ? or something else ? i ve decided i don t like riddles"
"thirty miles , if it don t piss on us"
"if things go wrong , you run"
"if the bull had fangs and claws , i would"
if he ever gets out
"if we don t take the foot now no , you can t ! ser ! please , ser"
i can t lose you ll die if she doesn t
you re going to kill joffrey ? if the gods give me strength
"if you want robb stark to hear us , we re going to have to speak louder"
we won t tell if you won t
"your grace , if your uncle finds out oh , i want him to find out"
"harder ! well , if it isn t my favorite whoremonger"
"if war were arithmetic , the mathematicians would rule the world"
"the marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest , if nothing else"
i fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital
"can that truly be you ? who else might it be ? when i saw your standard , i couldn t be sure"
"i suppose if we used the same one , the battle would be terribly confusing"
"if you were sons of mine , i would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers"
"if you heard a dothraki horde was approaching your city , you might do the same , khaleesi"
"if you do not let us in , all of us will die"
"only , as you said a moment ago , if we don t let you into the city , you will all die"
"if my sister was so concerned for pycelle , i would have thought she d come herself"
"cersei can keep him as a pet , if she wants , but i will not have him on the council"
but if your red woman told him to leap from the crow s nest she has a name
"if half an onion is black with rot , it s a rotten onion"
you can t avenge him if you re dead
"if it is justice that you want , be smart about it"
"and if renly wasn t a king , i wasn t a queen"
"why would i lie ? tell me , if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true , do you think it will make jaime more likely to kill you or less likely ? when i tell him you re fucking her , i mean"
"oh , lancel , tell my friend bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me"
please kill me if anything should happen to lord tyrion
"if you take king s landing with her by your side , the victory will be hers"
"there ll be spoils in it for you , and women , if you do yourjobs well"
and who decides if we ve done ourjobs well ? i do
my crew would wait on deck for a year if i asked them to
"and i m sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments , they would report growing discontent amongst the southern lords"
"if your name wasn t lannister , you d be scrubbing out pots in the cook s tent"
"but if it s been a thousand years , how do you know ? well i read it in a book"
if i could tell you how many crazy old men i ve seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit
"how much do you have ? if you could get real soldiers to man the catapults , then maybe you d hit your target one time in ten , but all the real soldiers are in the riverlands with your father"
"i don t know if you ve ever seen a battle , old man , but things can get a bit messy"
"and if qarth is the wealthiest city in essos the last time a rich man gave me a dress , he was selling me to khal drogo"
"but i could serve you , if you would have me"
"i will shield your back and give my life for yours , if it comes to that"
we can send two orphan boys from winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board
"if that s everyone , i m going to go for a ride before dark"
"do you need so many ? if we can t protect our own bannermen , why should they protect us ? go , ser rodrik"
i offered the greatest locksmiths in qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it
if you cross the sea with an army you bought the seven kingdoms are at war with one another
"and if i d listened to that advice outside the gates of qarth , we d all be dead by now"
"if you think you can hold the north with it shut up ! if you serve me as loyally as you served ned stark , i will be as good to you as he ever was"
if he were alive to see this he s not
"ser rodrik , i sentence you to death ! no ! you said no harm would come to them if i yielded"
"if you ever put my son s life at risk again , i ll leave us"
you say that as if you were the first man alive to think it
"if you will allow me to represent your family s interests , i believe that an advantageous agreement the tyrell host has returned to highgarden ? they have"
"and what else ? on your son tyrion s directive , i met with catelyn stark"
he can do it again if he has to
"if your people captured me , would they take me prisoner ? they d take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind"
"if not , they d kill you slow"
"we ve had vicious kings and we ve had idiot kings , but i don t know if we ve ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king"
"if she dies , you ll never get your uncle jaime back"
"of course , you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in qarth"
"but if you did not sit on it yourself , would it not be correct to say take the iron throne ? i didn t come here to argue grammar"
now if you ll pardon me
"how many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies ? but i dreamt that if i carried those eggs into a great fire , they would hatch"
"but if i remember my lessons , a woman of noble birth is always called a lady"
"what if i told you my father sold lace on the long bridge , and my mother , my brother and i lived with him above our shop ? i d call you a liar"
"if you ve got time , of course , for , well robb"
there is if you know where to look
if you light a fire no fire
we ll stay warmer if we stay close
how can i call myself king if i can t hold my own castle ? how can i ask men to follow me if i can t you are a king
"if you march all the way back north now , you ll lose what you gained"
but only if you serve me well
i would have given them bread if i had it
if the wrong people hear you but you re not the wrong people
"if not , i dreamed of food"
"if i find them soon enough , i won t hurt them"
"and if theon found out , he d hang them"
"if theon tracks us here , he ll torture them until he finds out where we are"
don t your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets don t call them that
move ! i heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don t use them
as if i d feel sorry for them
"if you re my prisoner , you re not a free woman"
that s the price you pay if you want to be a man of the night s watch
i don t care if you hanged
have you ever lost before ? do you think i d be in my position if i had lost a war ? but this is the one i ll be remembered for
"if you re going to pose as a commoner , you should do it properly"
"if i wanted your dragons , i would have taken them"
"if they say that xaro xhoan daxos is a liar , my word is worth nothing"
"if someone tried to tell us we couldn t lie down as man and woman , we d shove a spear up his arse"
"and what then ? she if every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative , ser alton , we d all hang"
if you need help finding these i know where to find them
if i could write a list
"and who is to be trusted ? who are my people ? the targaryens ? i only knew one , my brother , and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown"
"if the queen sees , i can have joffrey s children now"
"if she was your mother , you d know it"
"if i knew where they were , i would not tell you"
"you would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls , but qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change"
"and if you try and stop me you will strike me down ? have you forgotten me , ser ? i am the widow of your liege , lord eddard stark"
"he ll be at our gates within five days , four if he has the wind"
and if the entire city wants joffrey dead i m not the one giving the boy whores to abuse
if we can t control him do you think i haven t tried ? he doesn t listen to me
"what ? if this is the price for what we ve done , for our sins"
but what if your father despises the king ? what if the king massacres the innocent ? it s too much
i told you what would happen if you served me loyally
and what would happen if you did not
"what are you doing ? what have you done ? if there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says , here is the answer to your question"
"you know how valuable those boys were ? if i hadn t killed them , the northerners would think me weak"
"i still thought i could march south and rescue him in time , but only if i crossed that bridge"
"i asked him , how can a man be brave if he s afraid ? that is the only time a man can be brave , he told me"
"you commit treason because your children are prisoners ? i would carve out my heart and offer it to the father , if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell"
"if you re so confident , unlock my chains"
if you do what needs to be done
"and if stannis does attack the mud gate , what is our plan ? we could throw books at his men"
"if you find something you re not supposed to , best thing to do is pretend you ve never seen it"
if you help me and my friends escape
"if i do this thing , a girl must obey"
"and if he dies , there isn t a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt"
if we storm the castle he wouldn t dare hurt the boys
i m fighting a war and i don t know if i should march south or north
stay here if you re afraid
"away ! reset ! if the wind holds , we ll reach king s landing in a day"
"to strike ? my dear nephew , you do see these men preparing the walls for siege ? you do understand stannis baratheon sails this way ? if my uncle stannis lands on the shores of king s landing , i ll ride out to greet him"
"if we re going to play , you ll have to start"
"if stannis breaches the gates , the game is over"
"but even if what they say is true , it ll be years before they are fully grown"
"and if we stay in qarth , we ll die"
"if my dragons are in the house of the undying , then take me there"
"if you enter that place , you will never leave again"
"if they haven t got the damn message yet , a few more days won t help"
"are you afraid , my lion ? if the city falls , stannis will burn every lannister he can find"
"if you could if anything , a maester s duties become more urgent in times of war and turmoil"
"your grace , if i may ask you may not"
as if you don t know the name of every boy in town
the targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary
"strange as it sounds , i m the captain of the ship , and if the ship goes down , i go with her"
will you slay him yourself ? if stannis is fool enough to come near me
"the hand of the king would like me to tell you to tell the king if i tell the hound to cut you in half , he ll do it without a second thought"
"if it s true there is dissension in their ranks , maybe their sailors have mutinied"
remember that if you ever hope to become a queen
"i thought that if i prayed very , very hard , the gods would return my mother to me"
"it was expected of me , as it will be of you if you ever become joffrey s queen"
"if my wretched brother should somehow prevail , these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them , lifted their spirits"
"and if the city should fall ? you d like that , wouldn t you ? the red keep should hold for a time , long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to lord stannis in person"
"if it were anyone else outside those gates , i might have hoped for a private audience , but this is stannis baratheon"
"do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked ? no , you wouldn t , would you ? if the city falls , these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape"
"if you won t defend your own city , why should they ? what would you have me do ? lead"
"if he gets in , it will be your houses he burns , your gold he steals , your women he will rape"
"if your family would ask anything of me , ask it , and it shall be yours"
"but , if he s not marrying me he ll let you go home ? joffrey s not the sort of boy who gives away his toys"
"if you don t want what most men want , then you d better tell me what you d like me to do"
i would like you to tell me if working for lord baelish has been all you d hoped it would be
have we met ? you wouldn t remember me if we had ? i meet a lot of men
i think these women would understand if i don t care what you think
"a woman ! well , fuck me ! if you ve quite finished up all right , we ll be going"
"if this is the kingslayer , i think i d know about it"
"if he was , i d only be traveling his head"
if your father lived his life for one thing my father is dead
"if you see so much in your flames , why didn t you warn me ? the lord of light only allows me glimpses"
will you quit the war just because you ve lost a battle ? you talk about war as if you understand it
"and even if i did , even if by some miracle i slipped through the lines and made it home , i d be a coward"
"if it weren t for your squire s bravery , you d be a dead man"
"how did you know we d come this way ? after all the things you have seen , this is your question ? how did you kill those guards ? was it hard ? no harder than taking a new name , if you know the way"
"if you would learn , you must come with me"
"to be a dancing master is a special thing , but to be a faceless man , that is something else entirely"
"then what good is it ? if the day comes when you must find me again , just give that coin to any man from braavos and say these words to him , valar morghulis"
and if this is a dream i will kill the man who tries to wake me
"if you know what to say , you might just make it through the night"
"if you step back and think about it , the thing about gilly that s so interesting is just bloody kill me"
"if renly wasn t a king , i wasn t a queen"
they might if you do what needs to be done
if it weren t for your squire s bravery you d be a dead man
"if mance rayder likes you , you ll live another day"
and if he don t i smell a crow
my father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts
"if i m a traitor , then you are , too"
"what if you took off that bit there ? don t you want to leave something to the imagination ? trouble is , i ve never had much imagination"
"if i wanted to kill you , do you think i d let a wooden door stop me ? they stay outside"
"she lost an eye , if i remember correctly"
"if i remember correctly , she never stole a necklace again"
it s not slander if it s true
"and if you want me to carry on protecting you , you ll need to pay more"
"if i was a good father , he d still be here"
"if you fail , they will burn you"
"if you succeed , they ll burn you"
"and if you serve faithfully , you will be rewarded with a suitable wife"
if you were to tell just one person i won t tell anyone
"if they ll do it , others will"
"if i did , i d have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on dragonstone"
the lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart
"an open heart is what you ll get in flea bottom if you re not careful , my dear"
"if you would learn , you must come with me"
"if you were to tell just one please , lord baelish , tell me what to do"
"will i be wearing manacles when i lay my father to rest ? something else ? by the time bolton s bastard got to winterfell , the ironborn were gone"
"if lady stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service , i m sure she ll let me know"
but what if you re not ? what if he tells someone ? we re not doing it
"if he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you , i want you to tell me"
how could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair ? we should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me
who else would know better ? we ve heard some troubling tales
"have you lost faith in our cause ? if it s revenge , i still got faith in it"
if you no longer believe i can believe till it snows in dorne
"maester luwin said if he made it through the night , he d live"
"you liked him ? i like you , but if you re playing us false , it won t be hard for me to kill you"
i told them we were all going to die if we don t get south
"if you stop , you ll die"
"course if you don t stop , you ll probably die , too"
"if he can t , we may as well just go without him"
"if he doesn t , you don t"
"if you kill me , that wolf will tear you to bits"
"if we were going north , we should have come to the red fork river by now"
"how could we have passed it ? if we hit the red fork , we can follow it west to riverrun"
now do you think i m cruel ? only if you stop
what else have you seen ? only one thing that matters you
"if you kill me , you fail lady stark"
"but if you don t kill me , i m going to kill you"
"see ? if you were willing to hurt me , you might have had me there"
"looks like your woman s getting the better of you , if you can call that a woman"
"enough to buy me a new head ? if the king in the north hears i had the kingslayer and let him go , he ll be taking it right off"
"enough to buy me a new head ? if i may , nephew , i encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the stone mill which may have some bearing why don t you shut your mouth about that damned mill ? and don t call him nephew"
i think king robb understands we re not gonna win this war if he s the only one winning any battles
right here today at this gathering if you had been patient
"in stark s absence , roose bolton holds harrenhal , which would seem to make him lord of harrenhal , in practice if not in name"
"if you had armed me , they never would have taken us"
i was in chains if you recall
our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren t bound
"if you fight them , they will kill you"
"if you were a woman , you wouldn t resist ? you d let them do what they wanted ? if i was a woman , i d make them kill me"
"if i had a proper forge , i could make it good as new"
he s got to remain strong if he s to prevail
"and if he s useful , good"
if not throw him off the wall
see if crows can fly
if you do your job
i d have turned you all away if i wasn t a godly man
"if you can t ride , we don t stand a chance"
"is it we already , ser barristan ? if you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built , you must win it"
"if you buy them , the only men they ll kill are those you want dead"
"if they fail on the battlefield , they will bring shame upon all of astapor"
"i value your advice , but if you ever question me in front of strangers again , you ll be advising someone else"
"do you have a family ? a mother and a father you d return to if you had the choice ? no , your grace"
they will fall on their swords if you command it
if only the master of coin had such power
if only
"if i had a gold dragon for every time i heard that joke , i d be richer than you are"
"and what if i don t ? well , you have to"
but what if i don t ? this is why i don t lend you money
"if we fail to repay these loans , the bank will fund our enemies"
lord selwyn would pay his daughter s weight in sapphires if she s returned to him
"but only if she s alive , her honor unbesmirched"
"now that we re speaking together man to man , i wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree"
"i m not asking to be freed from my constraints , but if i could sleep lying down , my back would thank you for it"
"my father and if you get in any trouble , all you ve got to do is say my father and that s it , all your troubles are gone"
"and if you get in any trouble , all you ve got to do is say my father"
how many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass ? depends if he s had any practice
"if i die , you won t be getting oh , enough"
i have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it
if we want to live we ll have to look out for ourselves
"shall we go and see them ? if you give them your love , they will return it a thousandfold"
"and if i would start a war for that lecherous little stump , what do you think i am doing for my oldest son and heir ? whatever you can"
you ve allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city
"i have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot , as if that makes it smell any better"
it almost feels as if you re about to arrive at the point
"if robb stark falls , sansa stark is the key to the north"
"and if littlefinger marries her , he ll have the key in his pocket"
but he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes
if you wouldn t mind waiting back inside the keep
"or if you d be kind enough to give me your names , i ll ask the king to speak with you himself"
"and if you were to marry loras oh , your place would be at highgarden , wouldn t it ? we would be sisters , you and i"
"them that s dying , why don t you cut their throats and be done with it ? hmm ? or leave them if you ve not the stomach and i ll sort them myself"
"i ve got to feed my women ! so you admit you ve got a hidden larder , then ? how else d you make it through winter ? enough ! out ! i am a godly man"
"can i take this hood off yet ? i do apologize , little lady , but it s better for you if you don t see where we re going"
"if you mean to murder me , then bloody well get on with it"
"so , who will it be ? should we find out if your fire god really loves you , priest ? or you , archer ? what are you worth with a sword in your hand ? or is the little girl the bravest one here ? aye"
and if you were to marry loras you must give yourself to the lord of light
"beric dondarrion ? if you mean to murder me , then bloody well get on with it"
strike this man down if he is guilty
give strength to his sword if he is true
"if i knew where on the wall we were heading , i could tell you"
"but if you lie to me , i ll pull your guts out through your throat"
"if you want it , come steal it back"
i wonder if i might ask you for a favor
what good is the word extravagant if it can t be used to describe a royal wedding ? i understand that
"and if we don t provide them , they ll create their own"
"i served lord tywin at harrenhal , wondering every day if i d get tortured or killed"
"i m not fighting for justice if i don t serve justice to murderers in my ranks , no matter how highborn"
"if you do this , the karstarks will abandon you"
"if i faint , pull me out"
"tell me , if your precious renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men , women , and children burned alive , would you have done it ? would you have kept your oath then ? first , i killed the pyromancer"
if this is true why didn t you tell anyone ? why didn t you tell lord stark ? stark ? you think the honorable ned stark wanted to hear my side ? he judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me
if your father knew he said you were a traitor
"and a man of honor keeps his vows , even if he s serving a drunk or a lunatic"
"still , she ll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the seven kingdoms"
i don t know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home
"if we re truly her loyal servants , we will do whatever needs to be done , no matter the cost , no matter our pride"
"olyver , if it please you"
i d feel terrible if anything happened to you
"if you wish to stay , then of course you will stay"
and if i refuse ? you wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle
"if i knew where on the wall we were heading , i could tell you"
"if i had a bow , i could have shot a dozen rabbits"
"oh , you re gonna punch the rabbits to death ? i had someone else in mind"
"well , someone else is sitting right here"
"well , some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them"
the night s watch don t care if you live or die
mance rayder don t care if i live or die
we re just soldiers in their armies and there s plenty more to carry on if we go down
"and if you fall , don t scream"
"you staring at my ass , jon snow ? you all right ? just seeing if you can take a hit , lad"
"if you guess right , i ll tell you"
you win the game if you can figure out who i am and why i m torturing you and i win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger
"if i win , you ll let me go ? if you think this has a happy ending , you haven t been paying attention"
you swore to tell me if i you re right
you forgot to ask if i m a liar
our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the north can continue if his terms are met
it will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband
"if you refuse , our alliance with the freys is dead"
"if we don t do this and do it now , we re lost"
"if she wasn t his mother , he d have hanged her for treason"
or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution
"it would be , if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it"
"now , if the rumors about my children were true , then joffrey is no king at all and house tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt"
"and if cersei is too old to give loras children , we re throwing another prized flower into the dirt"
"if you refuse to marry loras to cersei , i will name him to the kingsguard"
whether or not you or father or anyone else wants to admit it
"if it weren t for your trick with the wildfire , stannis would have sacked the city before father got here"
what do you want me to say ? i want you to tell me if my life is still in danger
"alone , if i may"
"if i m going to be honest , i did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there"
our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the north can continue if his terms are met
"if you don t put some clothes on , i can t promise i won t attack you again"
you would if you were mine
"and your son , if i m not mistaken , your son might be the lord of casterly rock and the north someday"
i ll have to we ll have to if it s the pain you re worried about i m not afraid of the pain
"so if i wanted to attend a council meeting , i would now have to climb all the stairs in the tower of the hand ? we could arrange to have you carried"
"if they re wise , they ll hide behind those walls and chip away at us , man by man"
how many slaves are there in yunkai ? if not more
"if blood is your desire , blood shall flow"
children ? you think i want children who can never see their father ? who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them ? listen
my father will make him grand maester if he grows me a new hand
if he comes back we need to make him feel better
"if you re impressed by a windmill , you d be swooning if you saw the great keep at winterfell"
"if you attack the wall , you ll die"
"and if we die , we die"
"what if i belong in the north ? what if i fell from that tower for a reason ? is that what he s telling you ? that it s all for a reason ? all these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you ? i wish it were true , little lord"
if your father knew he said you re a traitor
"but if i live , i ll break both your hands"
"ask her , if you ever see her again"
they can be trusted to kill you if they re well paid
"even if your numbers are right , you must admit the odds don t favor your side"
"if we break our bond , no one will hire the second sons again"
i want to see if it s worth fighting for
"ser barristan , if it comes to battle , kill that one first"
"then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes ? if it needs to be done , do it"
"if the lamb sees the knife , she panics"
if you swear never to raise your hand to the lady melisandre again
"if only you could take that final step , you d see further than all the rest"
"if you ever call me sister again , i ll have you strangled in your sleep"
"and ? if you re going to give her one , you need to perform"
there will be if i command it
"but your father if my father wants someone to get fucked , i know where he can start"
what if i never want you to ? and so my watch begins
you thought of a name yet ? it would be easier to refer to him if he had a name
"if you attack the wall you ll die , all of you"
"if we take tywin s castle from him , the lords of westeros will realize he s not invincible"
we have enough men ? if walder frey cooperates
if walder frey cooperates
if reinforcements arrive from king s landing before we take the castle we ll be caught between tywin s army and the sea
"if you wanted to hide her , you shouldn t have brought her here in the first place"
"if we are truly her loyal servants , we ll do whatever needs to be done no matter the cost , no matter our pride"
"it leads through the wall right down into the nightfort , if one knows how to find it , which , it just so happens , i do"
ygritte ! clear the barn ! no one s going to believe you re a hog farmer if you eat them all
"if they hear us hush , hodor"
they ll find us if you don t
if this many wildlings got through i already told you
"if something happens to us , you re the heir to winterfell"
"but if she had her way , i would be back in volantis playing my harp and you would be sitting over there eating blackberries out of roslin frey s hand"
"what does my sire say ? to bed ! to bed ! to bed ! if you think the time is right , lord walder , by all means , let us bed them"
he said it wouldn t be right if he broke a man s jaw on our wedding night
"but if it s a boy , i know what we should name him"
"if i tell you it s over , it s over"
what if i never want you to ? and so my watch begins
you re a fool if you believe he s the most powerful man in westeros
he never would have risked such an action if he didn t have certain assurances
if the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat it wasn t for murder the gods cursed the rat cook or for serving the king s son in a pie
if he d been a trifle less arrogant calling himself the young wolf
robb stark offered amnesty for the ironborn if they gave us theon
i d be dead if it wasn t for jon
"if you re his brother , you re my brother , too"
"if jon is alive , then castle black s where he ll be"
"and if you saw it , too , you d run the other way"
"if you mistrust fancy people so much , why were you in such a hurry to trust her ? you re me"
if you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of tywin lannister i have a name
"if he wants me to leave , he can tell me himself"
everyone would do it if it were easy
"but if it weren t for my children , i d have thrown myself from the highest window in the red keep"
give it a nice firm mooring and what do you want ? mind if i keep warm ? fuck off
"i don t know if robb stark died because of the red woman s sorcery or because at war men die all the time , but i do know that uniting the seven kingdoms with blood magic is wrong"
"if what you say is true , a drop of his blood killed robb stark and our king is still no closer to the iron throne"
"if you finish it off , no matter how thirsty you get , don t drink seawater"
do you know what it takes to unite clans ? i told them we were all going to die if we don t get south
"but as long as i m better than everyone else , i suppose it doesn t matter"
"if you think your bloody honor comes before my bloody honor is beyond repair , but my answer is still no"
"if you haven t learned by now , you never will"
"if serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition , go serve"
"if he s so damned important , how come they sent you to meet him ? there s bad blood between the martells of dorne and the lannisters of casterly rock"
"sirs , if you follow me , i ll arrange for a private room"
groans he ll live if you get him help straightaway
"if there s anything i can do to make your stay what are you ? his hired killer ? it started that way , aye"
"prince oberyn , if i may , a word in private ? seems i visited the lannister brothel by mistake"
"if the mountain killed my sister , your father gave the order"
if i could have a moment alone with my wife
"what in the world are you talking about ? if you want me to leave , just say it"
you told me to come at once if there was anything important
"if he s not back yet , he s not coming back"
"if that boy s still walking , it s cause you let him go"
don t talk about the halfhand as if you knew him
"if we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl , the wall would be manned by headless men"
"now , how sad it will be if she s wearing rubbish like that"
"my lady , i know this is a very busy time for you , but if i could just have a moment"
"you think the great masters are worried ? if they re smart , your grace"
"if you want them to follow you , you have to become a part of their world"
you ve got the hair for it if not the looks
i don t have anything else left
"even if they were , you think i m gonna put you on your own horse ? watch the only thing of value i ve got in the world ride away ? why don t you have any money ? didn t you steal anything from joffrey before you left ? no"
i don t care if he ate your friend
always something if you know how to make them talk
"i understand that if any more words come pouring out of your cunt mouth , i m gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room"
"tansy ! if you make it out of the woods , you win ! run , tansy , run ! tansy"
"if they don t hear her , they won t hear us"
"the problem is , if you fight with an edged blade , i ll have to"
"and if i fight with an edged blade , i ll have no one left to pay me"
"if i still had my right hand plan on growing it back ? come on , then"
"if i m not a bolton , father , what does it matter ? go on , reek"
"if bran and rickon are alive , the country will rally to their side now that robb stark is gone"
"even if he doesn t , he s half stark himself"
my father will ask you if there s anything more and you ll tell him some clever lie
how long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying ? i have no pet sellsword to protect me
forgive me if i don t weep for you
why else would the lord of light have seen fit to mark her face ? she needs the rod
"i know that s tempting , but if you re trapped in summer for too long , you ll forget what it was to be human"
"and if we lose you , we lose everything"
"how do you know ? because if someone follows me without an invitation , i m the last person they ever follow"
what sort of monster would do such a thing ? as if men need more reasons to fear marriage
"perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes , he might be able to afford to bring you to highgarden for a visit"
"if you were to marry cersei , she d murder you in your sleep"
"if you somehow managed to put a child in her first , she d murder him , too , long before he drew his first breath"
what do you think i could do to you if you annoyed me ? i never meant to annoy anyone
"if it please your grace , lady sansa is very tired"
"joffrey ! joffrey ! if you want to live , we have to leave"
"and if they found you , how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king ? i didn t murder anyone"
less than you would have been if joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying
"if he had been , perhaps he d still be alive"
"if i m standing on it , it s my land"
how would it be if you stayed on till the new moon ? i could use a man to help with the farmwork
"and if any thieves came looking for easy pickings , one look at you , i d bet they d run the other way"
but no one s touched me if that s what you mean
i don t know if you re safe here
"if i do not press my claim , my claim will be forgotten"
i will not become a page in someone else s history book
you won t be a very good hand if you see the word knight and say ka nigit
you ll never read well if you move your lips
"what s the difference ? well , if you re a famous smuggler , you re not doing it right"
"i suppose if you work for the iron bank of braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom , you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction what was that for ? i need you to write a message"
"someday , if you re lucky , you will wake up and realize you are old"
"may we have the room ? call my name if you need me , lover"
"if i cut your throat today , i will be drawn and quartered tomorrow"
"i would like to think if i were arranging a royal assassination , i d plan it in such a way that i wouldn t be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died"
"any other witnesses , my lord ? varys could vouch for me if he dared"
"there s something else , my lord"
"a man , i didn t know his face , he came to ask if i d testify against you"
said i d be named ser podrick payne if i told the judges you d bought a poison called the strangler
"if they can t tempt you with honey , they ll choose something less sweet"
"do you hear me ? if i have to take that long walk to the executioner s block , i don t want to see your head already mounted"
"aye ! if we go after them , we ll be giving them what they want"
"if the wildlings breach the wall , they ll roll over everything and everyone for , miles before they reach an army that can stop them"
"and even if every one of us kills wildlings , there s still not a thing we can do to stop them"
they re not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them
"you re really asking if i killed your son ? are you really asking if i d kill my brother ? how can i help you ? well , you could set me free"
then there s really nothing else to say
"if the killer threw himself before the iron throne , confessed to his crimes , and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt , it wouldn t matter to cersei"
"if they don t know who you are or what you want , they can t know what you plan to do next"
"if they catch you , they ll put your head on a spike just like my father s"
"if i have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens , i ll fling myself from the cliffs"
you think i care if they like me ? we re at war
"she hoped or did you promise ? i swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive , i d return them to her"
"so if i told you to leave the capital right now and find sansa , if i told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head , would you do it ? i know you went to see tyrion"
he d kill us all if he could
but if my mother found out it can be our secret
"hmm ? if we re going to be man and wife , we ll have a few secrets from her , i hope"
i ve got something else for you
"if they re raiding the smaller villages , mole s town could be next"
"if mance learns what they know , we re lost"
"but if that s not enough , then consider this"
"if the night s watch are truly brothers , then lord commander mormont was our father"
"if it s a fight you re heading for , then you need men who know how"
shut up ! so if it worked for him let s give the walkers what they want
"if jon was here , why would they put his wolf in a cage ? they might have been night s watch once , not anymore"
"if i m not back soon , we ll meet hodor"
"if i was your size , i d be king of the fucking world"
he will need help if he s going to rule well
how can i rule seven kingdoms if i can t control slaver s bay ? why should anyone trust me ? why should anyone follow me ? you re a targaryen
"if you want to get to the eyrie , you need to go through the bloody gate"
"it doesn t matter how large your army is , if you attack this gate , you do it on this road , three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats"
"and on top of everything else , they made you marry that filthy troll"
"if you owe them money and you don t want to crumble yourself , you pay it back"
"if he were here right now , what would you do ? i d tell him to shut the fuck up so i can get some sleep"
i ll know if you lie
"if i were her , that s where i d go"
what do you think will happen if you leave ? they ll say i wasn t a very good squire
they will if you nance around like that
what good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love ? we can avenge them
"you like it rough , don t you ? you like it in the gutter , don t you ? if you let my sister go , i can help you"
"jon ! if he sees you , he won t let you go north"
what good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love ? you can avenge them
"your grace , if you d like to sit , i m sure that we ve been here since midday"
"but the courageous captain hollers , bring me my red shirt ! after the battle , the first mate asks , captain , why do you call for your red shirt before battle ? the captain replies , so that if i am stabbed , you will not see me bleed"
"if they catch us in here , we re trapped"
"what else ? more whispers from the east , my lord"
"how , my lord ? by force ? eventually , if it comes to that"
and if found guilty may the gods punish the accused
"if tyrion is found guilty , he will be punished accordingly"
what happens to your name ? who carries the lion banner into future battles ? your nephews ? lancel lannister ? others whose names i don t even remember ? what happens to my dynasty if i spare the life of my grandson s killer ? it survives through me
i ll take my place as your son and heir if you let tyrion live
"where s your sense of adventure ? even if you lose , imagine the look on father s face when you fall"
"if he wins , i expect i ll be in his debt for the rest of my life"
if he wins
"where else to sit ? tried to walk back to my hut , hurt too much"
"if i wanted wits , i d marry you"
"why did you bother to come here ? you once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out , you d double their price"
"but if you want me to kill the mountain for you , it d better be a damn big castle"
"if i emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders , i may one day rule the north in her name"
if and may and could
"if i gave you the choice between fucking lollys and fighting the mountain , you d have your britches down and your cock out before i could blink"
does he frighten you so much ? i d be a bloody fool if he didn t frighten me
"if i want you here , i will summon you"
so if i command you to stay in meereen and patrol the streets ? i ll stay in meereen and patrol the streets
"if they re lies , my lady , aren t they best avoided ? not always"
"i don t know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me , but whichever the case , she should stay home"
"if you want them to know something else , you ll have to show it to them"
i wouldn t be here to help you if ned stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of yunkai
"i know you don t like fire , but if you don t do it right no fire"
"can i get you anything else ? no , this will do nicely , thank you"
you wouldn t be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing
"if you find her , could you give her this ? she liked the last one i gave her , but , well , this one turned out better"
"if you want justice , you ve come to the wrong place"
"when we get married , you can tell me if you don t like somebody and then we can bring them back here and , whoosh ! right through the moon door"
if he tells aunt lysa let me worry about aunt lysa
"if you want to build a better home , first you must demolish the old one"
i don t care if you re sorry
as if i cut their thats self
"if they hit mole s town , then we re next"
"if the masters never cut me , i never am unsullied"
"and if you were my prince , why are you marching with a bolton army ? lord bolton took me captive after winterfell"
"if we yield , we live ? is that what it says on this paper here ? yes"
i suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally
lord baelish here is your uncle ? your name is alayne ? perhaps you would feel more comfortable if lord baelish left the room
why did the usurper pardon you ? if we could speak alone
"if we re fighting each other , we re not fighting him"
collect your pardon if you can
"if you re found in meereen past break of day , i ll have your head thrown into slaver s bay"
why did you help me ? they would have thrown you through the moon door if they found you guilty
"if they d have executed you , what would they have done with me ? i don t know"
i d have killed joffrey with a chicken bone if i had to
"but if she had , you would have ? you d have broken your vows ? the interesting thing is , our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women"
"and if not , the only thing left of him is gonna be his fun bits hanging around my neck"
"anyone else tries to kill him , i ll have an arrow for them"
how did you know that it was you ? who else but samwell tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night ? let me help you
old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else
do you know who i was before i came here ? what i could have been if i d only said the word ? of course you do
"if they find us out here , you don t know pyp ! open the gate"
you can say it if you like
"but if he starts second guessing himself , that s the end for him , for the clever little twats , for everyone"
not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back
"if you re afraid of a band of wildlings , how in seven hells did you manage to kill a white walker ? i didn t know i was going to kill it"
"if someone had asked me my name right then , i wouldn t have known"
everyone else hold
"if you keep missing , we will"
if they make it through they won t
"if they try the mammoths again , drop fire on them"
"if the climbers get too high , drop the scythe on them"
there won t be anywhere to hide if the castle falls
"and even if they did , even if you managed to kill him they ll kill me ? if i don t go , they ll kill me anyway"
"and if my people aren t south of the wall when it comes in earnest , we ll all end up worse than dead"
"you go back , you open the gates to us , and i swear to you that no one else will die"
"if my father had seen the things that i ve seen , he d also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall"
but if my past work is any guide we stand a chance
and if you recall i m not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won
i can speak the common tongue if you wish
take what they want and beat us if we resist
"even if they are safe , who would i be there ? what purpose would i serve ? with my master , i was a teacher"
"if you did it like i taught you , then the horses would be here"
"finally my father said , if you re going to do it , you might as well do it right"
i asked if you wanted something
"if one of those spokes in the wheel are missing , it s gonna collapse"
"i d be lying if i said the stress level is not increasing , because obviously this is very important for all of us"
"rosalia culora there s two departments filming at the same time , so it s imperative that things like wigs , continuity photos all travel together and that every member of the team is aware of what the look is , because if we do have to take over someone s artist , we know exactly what we re doing and there s no mess ups when we re watching the show , hopefully"
"if the plan to do that shot it s the boater s point of view , so it s looking through the fence"
"rock and roll , so shall we have a look look at this edge here and see if that works"
"if i jiggle , i sound like jingle bells"
"some of them look at my face and think if it s looking very long , we must be in trouble , but that s not the case"
welter soler the first day of shooting is always crucial to us because it shows us if everything we did in order to prepare it was the right thing
why not ? if your father he ll never know we re gone
but if he finds out you don t need to be afraid of my father
"if they catch you , they catch me"
are you a lord if you kill your father ? i don t imagine they revoke your nobility for killing a whore
"if it wasn t heavy , it wouldn t stop a sword"
if ser alliser is chosen as the new lord commander he hates the wildlings
"but if i m to take winterfell , i need more men"
"your grace , you want the wildlings to march in your army ? if they swear to follow me , i ll pardon them"
i ll offer them their lives and their freedom if mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty
"if he wanted to betray us , he already would have"
"you think i want that woman married to my brother ? if she doesn t marry me , she doesn t go to highgarden"
"if you sat on the iron throne , would you spread misery throughout the land ? i will never sit on the iron throne"
"you can stay here at illyrio s palace and drink yourself to death , or you can ride with me to meereen , meet daenerys targaryen , and decide if the world is worth fighting for"
"if you how many times must i say no before you understand ? whatever he wants from me , he s not going to get it"
if he really believes i m going to reopen the fighting pits you should reopen the fighting pits
"if he gets what he wants , i expect he ll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the iron throne the last hundred years"
"you brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter , not if they re north of the wall"
"but if you can t understand why i won t enlist my people in a foreigner s war , there s no point explaining"
i have nowhere else to go
you have everywhere else to go
cersei walder frey the mountain meryn trant must be good food if it s crowded
"i will shield your back and keep your counsel , and give my life for you if needs be"
lady sansa if we can have a word alone no
"please , my lady , if i can explain i saw you at joffrey s wedding bowing to the king"
"my lady if both stark girls refused your service , maybe you re released from your vow"
i will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her
"if i was a father to any of my children , they d be stoned in the streets"
"is there anything else , your grace ? you re going to dorne"
"we can have a harp , if you like , but no flutes"
"i ve been all over the world and if there s one thing i ve learned , is that meanness comes around"
"when i agreed to come with you , did i misrepresent my intentions ? besides , what else is there for me to do inside this fucking box ? you don t like it ? i want to take a walk"
i would take it if you don t mind
"i must say i can not uncle kevan , in light of your position as commander of the lannister armies , it would please the king if you would serve as his master of war"
"you would abandon your king in his time of need ? if he wants to send for me , i ll be waiting for him"
"if they don t fear you , they don t follow you"
"even if i wanted to , i m a bastard"
"if i don t take my own word seriously , what sort of lord of winterfell would that be ? hey"
if there s no one else we will begin the voting
what would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if stannis s army hadn t come along ? we all saw him put the king beyond the wall out of his misery
i just wanted to let you know if there s ever anything i can do for you you are very sweet
you can t hold the north if you let these lesser lords insult us
said the warden of the north would always be a stark and he d be damned if he d kiss a traitor s boot
we don t have enough men to hold the north if the other houses rise up against us
"if you think they will for us , you re a fool"
"if you didn t snap at me , i wouldn t learn anything"
"but if your mind s made up , i won t try and dissuade you"
"and the wildlings ? if they d rather burn than fight for me , so be it"
or you could see if this tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than mance ever was
"you cannot do this ! get your hands off me ! scum , all of you ! if the boy thinks he can frighten me , he s mistaken"
"kneel ! if you have any last words , my lord , now s the time"
"if he goes unpunished and where do i find this man ? this high sparrow ? i don t think this is a good idea , your grace"
inspect her if you must
"if you receive word in the night from the queen mother , it does make me question our new alliance"
i will not be of any use to daenerys targaryen if i lose my mind
"if anyone recognizes you , you ll lose more than that"
"if i could pick any girl here , i would pick you"
"if i m putting something like this together , a one handed man who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in westeros is not it has to be me"
"well , if you ever see the wee fucker , give him my regards"
"if i ever see him , i ll split him in two"
"if i explain their holy purpose to my son the king , i have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy"
what would you say if i told you of a great sinner in our very midst ? shielded by gold and privilege
"i m sure if you speak to the high sparrow , he ll release the poor boy"
"and if you re right ? stannis takes winterfell , he rescues you from the most despised family in the north"
"and what if you re wrong ? what if stannis never attacks winterfell ? or he does and the boltons defeat him ? then you will take this bolton boy , ramsay , and make him yours"
but you won t be around if he breaks em
how many do you think you can take ? one if he s slow
"if he gets to her before we do , we lose our only chance for revenge"
"if you d ever met my sister , you d understand"
glory ? why else do men fight ? why did your ancestors cross the narrow sea and conquer the seven kingdoms ? so their names would live on
i told you what would happen if you serve me loyally
and what would happen if you did not
what if i unchained you ? why would you do that ? because you are not my enemy
"you d bring wildlings here through our gates ? men , women , and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing"
"if we abandon them , you know what they become"
"if you have something you want to say to me , say it"
"will there be anything else you need , lord commander ? no"
better off with the boltons who murdered her mother and brother ? sansa s in danger even if she doesn t realize it
"if you re ever in trouble , light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower"
there s something else to help you remember
an apology doesn t mean anything if you re not looking the person in the eye
and if it s a boy ? you re worried about your position
if jon snow returns with the wildlings
"if i give everyone what they deserve , i ll have no one left to rule"
and you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart
"of course , i wouldn t have needed saving if you hadn t kidnapped me in the first place"
what would you say if i told you of a great sinner in our very midst ? may the father judge him justly
"if he gets to her before we do , we lose our only chance for revenge"
i have nowhere else to go
what if she conquers the world ? then what ? and prosperity ? first we have to conquer the world
"if war comes to westeros , will the knights of the vale fight for their king ? young lord robin heeds my advice"
if there s nothing else
what do you have to lose ? a brothel keeper ? and if you succeed ? name me warden of the north
what if he says no ? he won t
"if they arrested all the pillow biters in king s landing , there d be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else"
"if you apologize for that comment , perhaps i ll you ll get your apology when i get loras"
is there anyone else who can support your claim ? yes
why should the faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to highgarden ? your grace
"if you please , my lady , will you take my arm ? no"
"sansa is in danger , even if she doesn t realize it"
"if you re ever in trouble , light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower"
"and if you go north of the wall , gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them here"
but isn t your stepmother pregnant ? what of it ? what happens if she has a boy ? then i ll have a baby brother
what else ? the stormcrows rode off last night
"if i retreat again , i ll become the king who ran"
"if we march back to castle black , we winter at castle black"
"because if i don t , we ve lost"
"oh , if you were my girl , i wouldn t leave you alone"
i know they would have killed you if ghost hadn t come
"what kind of man would i be if i ran away when i saw someone hurting you ? just promise me whatever happens , you ll take care of little sam"
"my lord , if i may"
you might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits
"now , if you were to fight freed men who d be paid a wage there s your wages , funny man"
"so what else can i do , hmm ? marry me instead"
"even if i wanted to do such an inadvisable thing , i couldn t"
"if you break his laws , you will be punished"
"if you don t have one in your library , i ll give you my own"
"if it s equality you want , so be it"
events you couldn t possibly have anticipated or prevented even if you had
i ll start a war if i have to
"if he were a fighter , we might have been in trouble"
"it takes time to work , but if a single drop makes contact with the skin , death"
"if my house should fall , i will have nothing to hide"
"and if i should meet with some accident here at your broken little flesh market , they ll never even find what s left of you"
"but if you do happen to triumph here , you will fight at the great pit of daznak itself in front of the queen"
a trial will be held for each of them to determine if they re guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenets of the faith
if one or both of them were to confess before the trial then they will be shown the mother s mercy
there s no name on it or anywhere else in the chapel
how do i know you are who you say you are ? if only i were otherwise
"if you are tyrion lannister , why shouldn t i kill you to pay your family back for what it did to mine ? you want revenge against the lannisters ? i killed my mother joanna lannister on the day i was born"
it s too soon to know if you deserve my service
"if you d rather return to the fighting pits , just say the word"
if that is indeed what you are
what would you have me do with him ? i swore i would kill him if he ever returned
"and you re going to need to inspire devotion , a lot of it , if you re ever going to rule across the narrow sea"
"see what ? how can a man tell a girl this ? if he knew what she would see , there would be no reason to send her"
he only wins if he loses his life
"if the captain dies , the thin man pays his family a lot of money"
"a destitute woman and her small child , what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself ? to whom can they turn for recourse ? the many faced god"
and if she s not ? it is all the same to the many faced god
"what about my son , the king ? if you can visit me , then surely the king your arrest and queen margaery s arrest , the king has not taken them well"
"if it weren t for you , i d still have a family"
"if i could do what ramsay did to you right here , right now , i would"
"not to mention that the snow is so deep , we couldn t get an army through to engage them even if we wanted to"
"is that why you killed him ? someday , if you decide not to execute me , i ll tell you all about why i killed my father"
why did you travel to the far side of the world to meet someone terrible ? to see if you were the right kind of terrible
"if you chop off my head , well , my final days were interesting"
so if i m not going to be murdered and i m not going to be banished you re going to advise me
"if i want jokes , i ll get myself a proper fool"
have me flogged if it makes you happy
"if i win at the great pit , how much can you sell me for ? you re a free man"
wanted to ask you something if you ve got the time
"but what if we let the wildlings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep ? jon s taking a risk , but he has to"
since when do the crows give two shits if we live ? in normal times we wouldn t
the white walkers don t care if a man s free folk or crow
if ? if you swear you ll join us when the real war begins
they ll never have children of their own if we don t band together
my ancestors would spit on me if i broke bread with a crow
"if you say this is the way , we re with you"
they re gonna let them pass the wall even if you re not there ? you have my word
"if they get through , everyone dies"
if you swear you ll join us when the real war begins
"because if i don t , we ve lost"
"the snow is so deep , we couldn t get an army through to engage them even if we wanted to"
"forgive me , your grace , i never claimed to be an expert in military matters , but if we can t march forward and we won t march back have the dead horses butchered for meat"
he can guard all castles on the wall if he so wishes
"and if jon snow refuses the boy with the scroll , what does the boy say ? i didn t name you hand for your expertise in military matters"
"if the alliance between the iron throne and dorne is to continue , their engagement must stand"
"if anyone should be punished , it s me"
prince trystane must learn judgment if he is to rule one day
what if she s right ? luck
"if we come to a satisfactory arrangement , i ll be sure to send a cask of the arbor s finest your way"
"if a man charges no interest on a loan , then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose , so why chance it ? whereas the promise of reward makes a man willing to gamble"
no one would have blinked an eye at you if you d been named targaryen
if you had to choose between rhaenyra and aegon who would you have chosen ? i wouldn t have chosen either
if a man knows what he is and remains true to himself the choice is no choice at all
"if we don t act , we ll all starve here"
"but if we make this sacrifice accept this token of our faith , my lord , and lead us from the darkness"
at your command ? if need be
"and how many people will die to make this happen ? if it comes to that , they will have died for a good reason"
someone else s reason
"if you leave , who s left to give me advice i trust ? well , there s edd"
"if gilly stays here , then she ll die"
"if i m going to die , let it happen while there s still some of me left"
but if you re who s this ? no one at all
"do you think mother will like him ? if she sees you re happy , i m sure she will"
our queen would be dead if not for him
"if we re going to find her , that s where we ll have to go"
the only way we ll know is if we ask her
"if i ever kill you , your eyes will be wide open"
"if you leave , half this city will consume the other half"
"the birds sing in the west , the birds sing in the east , if one knows how to listen"
if only i knew someone with a vast network of spies
if only
"if your grace has given honest testimony , your trial will prove your innocence"
but if i might beg for just one drop of the mother s mercy
"may i have the honor of presenting the newest member of the kingsguard ? if it please your grace , he has taken a holy vow of silence"
"if they re gonna live in the seven kingdoms , safe behind our wall , they ought to fight for the damn place"
"if you were planning to see tomorrow , you picked the wrong room"
not if we have help
i will shield your back and keep your counsel and give my life for yours if need be
"i thought if i could make something so good , so pure maybe i m not a monster"
"they scream in agony and their shame is so great , they do not feel the flames , for now they see if not for a single sin they concealed , they were saved"
you think our friend got him ? don t know anything else that can melt a ram s horn
"maybe she s flown somewhere else , somewhere far away from men like us"
if you grow old
if i grow old
"chatter continues waif are you listening , blind girl ? do you hear them talking ? do any of them talk to you ? no"
i ll need some food if i m gonna make it south without starving
you can bring the red woman with you if you like
it s a sad fucking statement if dolorous edd is our only chance
"we don t need to die , not if we have help"
"lady sansa , i will give my life for yours if need be"
"if he ever learned to fight , he d be unstoppable"
"it is beautiful beneath the sea , but if you stay too long , you ll drown"
if she had tried they re not putting your mother in a cell ever again
"if i can t even protect my own wife or my own mother , what good am i ? go and see your mother and ask her to forgive you"

"if a girl says her name , a man will give her eyes back"
"if you acquire a reputation as a mad dog , you ll be treated as a mad dog"
"not if our captains defy my orders , abandon their posts , and sacrifice our men on foolish missions"
"does he have to be ? what are you asking ? do you know of any magic that could help him ? bring him back ? if you want to help him , leave him be"
"by yourself ? with a baby and no money ? so if we re not going to oldtown , where are you taking me ? to my home"
us and everyone else in the world
"if you think it s for the best , we trust you"
i d feel better if you threw something at me and stormed off
your friend the usurper would lie beneath the ground if we had been
if we could have the room
"if you re going to torture me , just call them back and get on with it"
"if i tell you anything , they ll kill me"
what would you be talking about if i weren t here ? patrol
"if i m wrong , i drink"
and if i m right maybe we can t play without drinking
"if the unsullied march off to reconquer astapor and yunkai , who will remain to defend the free people of meereen ? if we do not fight them , how can we stop them ? we cannot"
"if we want them to hear us , we must speak it back to them"
"laughing now remember , if any of your friends like sweets or need help , they can always come to me"
"if someone is planning on making our losses their gains , i want to hear it"
"if someone is laughing at the queen who walked naked through the streets covered in shit , i want to hear"
her love for you is more real than anything else in this world because it doesn t come from this world
"if we re to be just and good , then we accept it , all of us , even kings"
grunts waif who were you before you came here ? arya arya stark
grunts waif tell me about arya stark s family
who else was on arya stark s funny little list ? groans arya cersei lannister
rustling waif that s a short list
"are you sure you re not forgetting someone ? which name would you like a girl to speak ? shouts jaqen if a girl tells me her name , i will give her eyes back"
"if a girl is truly no one , she has nothing to fear"
i might have done the same to my father if he hadn t have done me the favor of dying on his own
"you think a horde of wildlings can take winterfell ? if they get jon snow leading them , maybe"
"if you have any last words , now is the time"
"if i had to do it all over knowing where i d end up , i pray i d make the right choice again"
"where will you go ? where will we go ? if i don t watch over you , father s ghost will come back and murder me"
you think they ll be safe here if roose bolton remains warden of the north ? sansa
"if we don t take back the north , we ll never be safe"
but i ll do it myself if i have to
"if we could trust his absolute loyalty , he would make a capable commander in the wars to come"
see if it doesn t taste every bit as good as what came before
"if you betray her work , you are my enemy"
they re trustworthy if they re convinced that working with me is in their self interest
"what do i have to gain ? if i win , i m the shit who killed an old man"
"if i lose , i m the shit who was killed by an old man"
"isn t it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi ? if they spot us and we re unarmed , we ll say we re traders heading for the western market"
but if they see weapons you re asking a dog to hand over his teeth
"you all right ? if they find a body with a stab wound , the whole city will be looking for us"
"speaking dothraki if i were to let you leave right now , where would you go ? door closes what would you seek out ? i d go to my brother , my husband , my family"
"everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor , lying in heaps next to their fine clothes"
"and if either of us give in to what they want , then they win"
if he found out i told it would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly given his constant prattling about the truth
"are you expressly forbidden from standing down ? no , but if the king should call the whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything"
"if it doesn t go as planned , the sparrows have many friends in this city"
"sobbing why did you come here ? where else could i go ? you heard father was dead and you thought you d claim the crown ? no , no"
they ll fight for you if you ask
"to come to my aid ? did you know about ramsay ? if you didn t know , you re an idiot"
"if you did know , you re my enemy"
"what else do you think he did ? sansa , i what else ? did he cut you ? maybe you did know about ramsay all along"
you won t even be able to protect yourself if i tell brienne to cut you down
"and why shouldn t i ? do you want me to beg for my life ? if that s what you want , i will"
what if i want you to die here and now ? then i will die
"and now a girl is one of them , if a girl desires"
you need to know that if we re going to be intimate
if a girl could use one of the faces from the hall a girl is not ready
a girl must decide if she wants to serve the many faced god
he was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren t for me
"if not for your mutilation at the hand of a second rate sorcerer , you wouldn t be here helping the lord s chosen bring his light into the world"
"if you are her true friend , you have nothing to fear from me"
"if we want to survive , we need winterfell and to take winterfell , we need more men"
"if jon s going to convince them to fight alongside him , they need to believe it s a fight they can win"
"but if you have to fight , win"
"i didn t think i d ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and , well , threaten to kill me if i didn t"
"if he thinks that little sam is his grandchild , he ll take you in"
"he hoped i d make a man of myself by killing some bloody wildlings , so it s probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible"
you can choose one of my bedrooms if you want
"if he were to become lord tarly of horn hill , it would be the end of this house"
who else would have him ? but i overestimated him
it s time to see if truth they told who said tywin lannister shits gold
"madness has had its day ! captain forward , march ! rich or poor , noble or common , if we sin , we must atone"
"if i want excuses , i ll put her in charge"
"but if you kill the high sparrow , you won t leave the sept alive"
if the gods are real why haven t they punished me ? they have
the king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work
if i tell them to stop
"if he does , the faith will allow him to return to highgarden"
"tormund if it weren t for him , none of us would be here"
"and if we lose this , we re gone"
that s what ll happen to you if we lose
"i need you with me if we re going to beat them , and we need to beat them if you re going to survive"
"if we are not willing to do the same for him , we re cowards"
"and if that s what we are , we deserve to be the last of the free folk"
i wonder if you re the worst person i ve ever met
"if you re half as bright as you think you are , you ll find a way out of here , too"
"if that s not to your liking , go home"
if you say so
"so why should i sacrifice one more mormont life for someone else s war ? if it please , my lady , i understand how you feel"
but i m here because this isn t someone else s war
"he chose jon to be his successor because he knew he had the courage to do what was right , even if it meant giving his life"
"if they re half as ferocious as their lady , the boltons are doomed"
if you can breach the walls
"but if you surrender , i ll spare the lives of your men"
"lord glover , if you could just hear us out"
there s nothing else to say
"if i got justice , my burnt body would hang over the gates of winterfell"
"if you re so broken that there s no coming back , take a knife and cut your wrists"
"but if you re staying , theon , i need you"
but we still have a chance if we re careful and smart
"if we went down to castle cerwyn , i know that lord we fight with the army we have"
"you ve got food , you ve got steel even if you say you don t"
even if it s to protect yourself ? violence is a disease
it s time to see if truth they told who said tywin lannister shits gold
"trust me , if my soup didn t kill you , nothing will"
"if you shaved your beard with a straight razor , you d say the razor worked"
"if i don t return , you ll know i was wrong"
if you refuse to come of your own free will get out
not everybody wants to die for someone else s home
"if i persuade him to abandon the castle , you ll grant a safe passage north"
"yes , lady brienne ? should i fail to persuade the blackfish to surrender and if you attack the castle , honor compels me to fight for sansa s kin"
"and if he were here now , i d tell him the same i m telling you"
"if you think i m abandoning my family s seat on the kingslayer s word of honor , you re a bloody fool"
"and if jaime lannister wants it , he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does"
if you break his laws you will be punished
"i m sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you , but rebelling against the crown does have consequences"
she hit me on the head with a rock if i remember correctly
you can laugh at that if you want
"and if i have to slaughter every tully who ever lived to get back to her , that s what i ll do"
"man aye , ser ! black walder if you re wrong , we ve just surrendered our most valuable prisoner"
if the slavers forces no more talking from you
"if we go to the beach , the masters will take the pyramid"
"footsteps approach groans thuds gasping lady crane ? winces lady crane ? if you d have done your job , she would have died painlessly"
"because if meereen succeeds , a city without slavery , a city without masters explosions it proves that no one needs a master"
"if you had not been so arrogant , you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships"
i don t know if i d beat you
"tell me , will you let your little brother die because you re too proud to surrender ? how do we know you have him ? now , if you want to save you re going to die tomorrow , lord bolton"
"jon if he was smart , he d stay inside the walls of winterfell and wait us out"
"if the other houses sense weakness on his part , they ll stop fearing him"
if they feel the tide turning it s not his men that worry me
"if we let him buckle our center , he ll pursue"
"if you had asked for my advice earlier , i would have told you not to attack winterfell until we had a larger force , or is that obvious , too ? when will we have a larger force ? we ve pleaded with every house that ll have us"
"if ramsay wins , i m not going back there alive"
"if i do , if i fall don t bring me back"
"if the lord didn t want me to bring you back , how did i bring you back ? i have no power"
can t imagine you would have murdered the stark boys if things had been going well
he would have murdered us if we d stayed
"what if everyone starts demanding their independence ? she s not demanding , she s asking"
"if i don t return , you ll know i was wrong"
please forgive me if you can
"why do you think they re not here ? if the accused is not here , she will be tried regardless"
"where are they now ? you talk about war as if you re an expert , but the one battle i remember you fighting , you were captured by robb stark , the young wolf"
"if we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them , why do we need you ? show me"
"if he commands you to burn children , your lord is evil"
"if the lord was done with me , so be it , but he s not"
"if you return to the north , i ll have you hanged as a murderer"
"if you ever come back this way , i will execute you myself"
we must be allies now if we wish to survive
"new strategy ? you want the second sons to attack from the west coast ? if we take casterly rock , the lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit king s landing"
"if i m going to rule in westeros , i ll need to make alliances"
"that s the kind of self sacrifice that makes for a good ruler , if it s any consolation"
i m not sure if it s right
"knife blade rings groaning forgive me , my lady if you re at prayer"
"whenever i consider an action , i ask myself will this action help to make this picture a reality ? pull it out of my mind and into the world ? and i only act if the answer is yes"
"whispering if robert finds out , he ll you know he will"
"if the maesters are right , it ll be the coldest one in a thousand years"
i don t care if he s a bastard
"if you re gonna be bad , be really bad"
"he knows what it means too , and he knows that if the incest is discovered , not only will he and his sister be put to death but their three children may very well too"
"i would let his whole tribe fuck you , all , men , and their horses too , if that s what it took"
if they want to survive they have to start to be resilient
if she s got something to do she s gonna do it and she s not gonna let other people stand in her way
calling yourself king doesn t make you one and if renly wasn t a king i wasn t a queen
"she knows she needs an army , a powerful army too , if she ever wants to reclaim the westerosi throne and the best bet for that are the unsullied"
dracarys ! because you would take power if you have the force of a dragon
lord selwyn would pay his daughter s weight in sapphires if she s returned to him
i think the bolton s want pretty much what everyone else seems to want
"if he s been let down by robb stark after this promise , if he shows any kind of forgiveness or , just let it go , we didn t want to marry my daughters , marry someone else , he would lose face , in that world , it s a vicious world he s operating in"
catelyn in her heart knew that you do not break a promise if you are the king of the north and also you certainly don t break it to walder frey
we re the hottest couple at the wedding what else is there to say ? ellaria sand
"actually , she s got nothing else to lose"
"if my father had seen the things that i ve seen , he d also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall"
"she s had the dragons now for quite a long time but her actually becoming a dragon rider , that s her claiming her birthright more than i think anything else we ve seen her do because that is how the targaryan s wielded their power"
"arya , i think has crossed a line , and if you look back to season one , what would ned stark think of arya s actions"
"in a desperate move , stannis follows the advice of the red priestess who promises him victory if he makes an unspeakable offering to the lord of light"
she s believed in this god for so many years i think that if it s not to do with the god she kind of just blocks everything out and i think that s what happened as she blocked out the fact that she was going to be sacrificing a child
"melisandre really thought that stannis would be the one and you know she s put a lot of her heart and soul and everything else into , into helping him"
"now , if you want to save you re going to die tomorrow , lord bolton"
"ramsay should have won , he was much more conniving , much more cunning , and if it hadn t have been for sansa coming in at the last minute , then he probably would have won"
"if you were face to face with your nemesis and you had the opportunity , you d take it"
"in the moment where she gets her revenge on everyone else , she loses the only thing that she has left that matters to her"
"if viserys had three dragons and an army at his back , he d have invaded king s landing already"
"if the great houses support your claim against cersei , the game is won"
"if he dislikes one monarch , he conspires to crown the next one"
"if you demand blind allegiance , i respect your wishes"
"but if you let me live , i will serve you well"
"if you ever think i m failing the people , you won t conspire behind my back"
"and i swear this if you ever betray me , i ll burn you alive"
"if he does rule the north , he would make a valuable ally"
"but ? but if the army of the dead makes it past the wall , do we have enough men to fight them ? if the mad king s daughter takes the iron throne , she ll destroy the realm as we know it"
"we must stand together , all of us if we hope to stop her"
they might not have come if you hadn t
"if my queen summons me , i answer the call"
"and if they can be wounded , they can be killed"
if you ll kindly pull that lever
"yara if you want the iron throne , take it"
"if we turn the dragons loose , tens of thousands will die in the firestorms"
"if we besiege the city with foreigners , we prove her point"
"if he learns to swim , good"
"if he drowns , good"
"archmaester , i wondered if i and this one"
"um , i wanted to ask you if you re going to write histories , tarly , you have to do the research"
"if you want people to read your histories , you need a bit of style"
"um , archmaester , if i could just have a moment"
coughing clears throat if you could take off your shirt
"grunts if you wouldn t mind , bite down hard"
"i m sorry , but no one knows i m here , and if they hear you screaming , then we re both finished"
"but no one else will try it , so i m the best you ve got"
"if she lays siege to king s landing , prices will triple"
"she has a powerful army at her back and , if this message is to be believed , three dragons"
"not even thank you ? if it weren t for me , you d have been slaughtered on that battlefield"
"so , if someone gets too close to you he might have to intervene"
you were pissing off the edge if i remember right
if you wouldn t mind handing over your weapons
"if i was your hand , i would have advised against it"
i would only be a distraction if i stayed
"if you don t mind my saying , i don t think you should return to westeros"
"because right now , you and i and cersei and everyone else , we re children playing at a game , screaming that the rules aren t fair"
"your grace , everyone you know will die before winter s over if we don t defeat the enemy to the north"
if they get past the wall and we re squabbling amongst ourselves we re finished
"robert was your father s best friend , no ? i wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib"
you ll be ruling over a graveyard if we don t defeat the night king
"but if destiny has brought daenerys targaryen back to our shores , it has also made jon snow king in the north"
"he gave his own if we don t put aside our enmities and band together , we will die"
"if it doesn t matter , then you might as well kneel"
you wouldn t be here if you tried
"and if you turn on us , they ll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike"
"listen , if you have any advice at all , i would love to hear it"
"if i close my eyes , i can hear the sound of oberyn s skull breaking"
if only he hadn t taunted him
"if you refuse to eat , we ll force food down your throat"
if someone told me about the white walkers and the night king you probably don t believe me
i m asking if there s something i can do to help you
"if he s wrong , it s worthless"
"you re telling me we don t have enough food , especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend winterfell ? no , my lady , most likely not"
"if we don t use it by winter s end , we ll give it back to them"
"but if the entire north has to flee to winterfell , they won t have enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them"
if you turn your back on her you don t know cersei better than anyone here
"if he was so clever , why didn t he take highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry ? scoffs i suppose i ll be able to ask him myself soon enough"
"if she s driven you this far , it s gone beyond your control"
you wouldn t be here if you d tried
"the other dagger , the one that took her life , i would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if i could have"
"crying i remember what it felt like to be brandon stark , but i remember so much else now"
"if jon s gone , who s in charge of winterfell ? the lady of winterfell"
"if i m not who i say i am , i won t last long"
"but if i am and sansa finds out you turned me away right , you sit there"
"cause if you don t , i m gonna hit you right in the fucking face as hard as i can"
i was angry when i heard someone else had done it
who else is on your list ? most of them are dead already
"there is something else i want to show you , your grace"
we need to do the same if we re going to survive
they will if their king does
"if i have underestimated our enemies our enemies ? your family , you mean"
what kind of a queen am i if i m not willing to risk my life to fight them ? a smart one
"but if you use them to melt castles and burn cities , you re not different"
"if they haven t contributed the right amount of grain to the stores , then i m afraid they ll have to make due with what they ve brought"
"if i may , how did a slave girl come to advise daenerys targaryen ? she bought me from my master and set me free"
and if you wanted to sail home to naath tomorrow ? then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune
will you forgive me if i switch sides ? bell ringing jon is that a greyjoy ship ? men shouting man shouts man halt ! jon
"do you fight with us or with the fallen savages and eunuchs ? daenerys targaryen what do you think i should do ? if you use them to melt castles and burn cities , you re not different"
"if she decides to use them , to really use them you re fucked"
"whatever else he is , he is a true soldier"
"if that becomes an option , many will take it"
"your grace , if you start beheading entire families i m not beheading anyone"
"not the same as our men , but they ll fight if they re well paid , which they will be"
"and you believed her ? if you were olenna , would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to joffrey or tommen ? which one would margaery have been better able to control ? which one would have made olenna the true ruler of the seven kingdoms ? she was telling the truth"
"and if we don t find a way out of this war , we ll follow them"
"no matter how big they get or how terrifying to everyone else , they re my children"
you found a cure ? i wouldn t be here if i hadn t
"i return to your service , my queen , if you ll have me"
"and ? somehow , a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could"
"if you tell people the threat is real , they ll believe it"
"if you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall , they ll do it"
"and if you tell every maester in the citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night , they may find something that lets us defeat the army of the dead for good"
"what else could she do ? not burn him alive alongside his son ? i am her hand , not her head"
"if they make it past the wall the wall has kept them out for thousands of years , presumably"
what if we prove her wrong ? i don t think she ll come see the dead at my invitation
"and how would you get into king s landing ? i can smuggle you in , but if the gold cloaks were to recognize you , i m warning you , i m not a fighter"
"well , it will all be for nothing if we don t have one of these dead men"
not if they lose their heads first
"and if jon doesn t come back , you ll need their support so you can work together to give you what you really want"
what if someone takes the boat ? then we re fucked
"listen to me i once told bronn that if i ever saw you again , i d cut you in half"
she s even willing to suspend the hostilities if cersei agrees to certain terms
"if you want cersei to bend the knee , you can ask her yourself"
"well , who should i say i am ? i told you , clovis , if we don t get out of here soon , someone s going to gold cloak you there ! no weapons , friends"
"if we want to beat her , we have to be clever"
"but if what you said is true about what s up there , i can t wait out this war"
"your grace , i if i don t return , at least you won t have to deal with the king in the north anymore"
maynard says here that he issued an annulment for a prince ragger and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in dorne
"so , you ve met this dragon queen , huh ? and ? she will only fight beside us if i bend the knee"
"and would have killed me if it weren t for but they didn t , did they ? so what you winging about ? i m not winging"
ser rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw
"do you know how happy cersei would be right now if she saw us fighting ? this is exactly what she wants , what she always wanted"
they wouldna t think much of lady sansa if they knew how she did cersei s bidding
if i ever get back there
"so if all goes well , i ll finally get to meet your sister"
"but if we go to the capital , we ll go with two armies , we ll go with three dragons , and anyone touches you , king s landing burns down to the foundation stone"
"are we ? laying any traps ? if we want to create a new and better world , i m not sure deceit and mass murder is the best way to start"
"which war was won without deceit and mass murder ? yes , you ll need to be ruthless if you re going to win the throne"
"if that s the kind of queen you want to be , how are you different from all the other tyrants that came before you ? so we walk into the lion s den ? my brother promised me he d keep a grip on the lannister forces"
you need to take your enemy s side if you re going to see things the way they do
"and you need to see things the way they do if you re going to anticipate their actions , respond effectively and beat them"
"perhaps if you d planned for the short term , we wouldn t have lost dorne and highgarden"
"if they found out i wrote that letter a woman who s already married not one but two enemies of her house by the time jon comes back , he ll have no army left"
she would if she thought i was going to betray jon
"and if one of you were planning to harm the other in any way , wouldn t she be honor bound to intercede ? she would"
where s the rest of them ? if we wait long enough we will find out
"you don t understand the lord brought you back he brought me back no one else , just us"
"if i abandon you the trip to king s landing is long , lady brienne , and you won t be travelling on summer roads"
who else can ? no one
you can t win the throne if you re dead
you can t break the wheel if you re dead
if you die we re all lost
"if you fool me , you win"
"if i catch a lie , you lose"
"how do you feel about jon being king ? is there someone else you feel should rule the north instead of him ? those faces , what are they ? is that what you should be asking ? are you sure ? the game of faces didn t turn out so well for the last person who asked me questions"
if we hadn t gone i wouldn t have seen
sansa stark she would if she thought i was going to betray jon
"if you want cersei to bend the knee , you can ask her yourself"
what if we prove her wrong ? bring the dead to her
if we live that long
you wouldn t find me fighting in an army if i had no cock
"if anything goes wrong , kill the silver haired bitch first , then our brother , then the bastard who calls himself king"
who s protecting her if you re here ? the only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way
i m sure your new queen will be happy to restore yours if she ends up on the throne
"if that s not looking after myself , i don t know what is"
"if you don t submit to me here , now i ll kill her"
"if all we wanted was more of the same , there would be no need for this gathering"
i wouldn t be here if it weren t
"if my brother jaime has informed me correctly , you re asking me for a truce"
"if we don t win this fight , then that is the fate of every person in the world"
"if those things come for us , there will be no kingdoms to rule"
"and if you did , i would trust you even less than i do now"
"if it s all for nothing , then he died for nothing"
"talk about my father if you want , tell me that s the attitude that got him killed"
hate me for it if you want
no one would ve touched them if father was here
"if it weren t for me , you d have a mother"
"if it weren t for me , you d have a father"
"if it weren t for me , you d have two beautiful children"
you know it in your heart if there s anything left of it
"if there s no future , then why are we here ? why did you allow me to come ? not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction"
"if i had trusted you , everything would be different"
"even if i wanted to , arya would never go along"
"waves crashing if we have the dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad , they ll arrive at winterfell within the fortnight"
"but if we re going to be allies in this war , it s important for the northerners to see us as allies"
"if we sail to white harbor together , i think it sends a better message"
and it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we re going to fight together
"even if euron hasn t cut her throat yet , she s dead"
"protected me ? by selling me to the boltons ? if we could speak alone , i can explain everything"
"if the north falls , we fall"
"if dragons can t stop them , if dothraki and unsullied and northmen can t stop them , how will our armies make a difference ? this isn t about noble houses , this is about the living and the dead ! and i intend to stay amongst the living"
our child will never be born if the dead come south
"you understand that , don t you ? if the dead win , they march south and kill us all"
"if the living win , and we ve betrayed them , they march south and kill us all ! the targaryens and the starks already want to kill us all"
i wasn t sure if you d remember me
"lord umber when can we expect your people to arrive ? we need more horses and wagons , if it please my lady"
"if anyone survives the war to come , we ll have jon snow to thank"
if i kill you who can i talk to ? hmm ? sighs
if it s the dragon queen she s after she has other plans for the targaryen girl
"yara euron can t defend the iron islands , not if he s in king s landing with all his men and his ships"
daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can t hold the north
if you d follow me varys the karstarks
"on the off chance that we survive the night king , what if the seven kingdoms , for once in their whole shit history , were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man ? tyrion they do make a handsome couple"
"if it makes you feel any better , she didn t like me either when we were growing up"
if she can t respect me man speaks dothraki indistinctly
"what if he doesn t want me to ? then i ve enjoyed your company , jon snow"
"it s not a bad place to grow up , if it wasn t so cold"
"oh ! so you re the man ? um which man am i , your grace ? the one who saved ser jorah when no one else could"
"if it s not too much trouble , i could use a pardon"
not randyll tarly ? you know him ? i offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee
robert would have murdered you if he knew
"if the horses last , we ll get there before the dead"
tense music plays dragon shrieks ser davos seaworth what if the seven kingdoms were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man ? samwell tarly you re aegon targaryen true heir to the iron throne
"even if we defeat the dead , she ll have more than enough to destroy the survivors"
"why would he do that if he weren t telling the truth ? perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him , right up to the moment he slits my throat"
"if you trust him with yours , we should let him stay"
"if you can t help me take it back , i ll find another hand who can"
"you still would be , if you hadn t pushed me out of that window"
i m something else now
why didn t you tell them ? you won t be able to help us in this fight if i let them murder you first
"if we can keep a tight formation , we might be able to beat them back"
"but i d be honored to serve under your command , if you ll have me"
"when i named him hand , i didn t know if i d ever see you again"
"and one other suggestion , if you ll allow me"
and we said we d never bow to anyone else again
"but why aren t you with her ? i want to fight for winterfell , lady sansa if you ll have me"
"if i can live through that , you can live through this"
if he falls getting to him may be our best chance
"if that s true , he ll never expose himself"
"if we forget where we ve been and what we ve done , we re not men anymore"
"if i wanted to erase the world of men , i d start with you"
"if we survive , i ll need it"
"if they re in the field , they re not protecting bran"
"if only we were trapped in a castle in the middle of winter , with nowhere to go"
"is there nothing else you want to do , nothing else you want to see ? naath"
if you want to join them to protect them
"well , if that s what it s come to , we really are fucked"
as if we needed any more signs the world was ending
things would be easier if it were
"because if you are , the lord of light s gonna wonder why he brought you back times just to watch you die when i chuck you over this fucking wall"
"but if i were , i d knight you times over"
i d be honored if you d take it
"robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out , and lyanna knew it"
"if it were true , it would make you the last male heir of house targaryen"
"if we were up there , we might see something everyone else is missing"
if i was out there right now you d die
if it were true you d have a claim to the iron throne
"if this isn t the time to drink , when is ? the last time i saw her , i told her i d kill her if i ever saw her again"
and what if i m not trying to be happy ? then you re in luck
none of it would have happened if you d left king s landing with me
"all i know is that you re beautiful , and i love you , and none of it will be worth anything if you re not with me"
"if he could have chosen a way to die , it would have been protecting you"
"if i didn t know , i d be happy right now"
i don t know what else i can say
even if the truth destroys us ? it won t
"if the iron fleet tries to ferry in more food , the dragons will destroy them"
"if the lannisters and the golden company attack , we ll defeat them in the field"
they ll fight better if they have time to rest and recuperate
tyrion so if all are in agreement jon and ser davos will ride down the kingsroad with the northern troops and the bulk of the remaining dothraki and unsullied
you understand we d all be dead if not for her
"if you only trust the people you grew up with , you won t make many allies"
how can i promise to keep a secret if i don t even know what it is ? because we re family
"if cersei s dead , she can t pay up"
"of course , the odds change if the dragon queen s hand turns up dead"
"do you remember ? if anyone offered me money to kill you , you d pay me double"
"he wouldn t be talking to us if the way i see it , i only need one of the lannister brothers alive"
gonna leave me to die again if i get hurt ? probably
i d feel much better about the future if i left here today believing that you and daenerys were allies
what if there s someone else ? someone better ? you re not gonna ride the dragon south ? just a horse
"if it s a boy , we want to name him jon"
"if a handful of people know now , hundreds will know soon"
"if we marry them , they could rule together"
"if she wants to take the castle , she ll have to murder thousands of innocent people first"
i promised you i would look you in the eye and speak directly if i ever thought you were making a mistake
"varys cersei needs to be destroyed , but if we attack king s landing with drogon and the unsullied and the dothraki , tens of thousands of innocents will die"
"if there s a chance to avoid the coming slaughter , we should make the effort"
even if you know it s a mistake ? i believe in our queen
"millions of people , many of whom will die if the wrong person sits on that throne"
"if she refuses , missandei of naath will die here and now"
"if not for yourself , then for your child"
"if you have any last words , now is the time"
what if there s someone else ? someone better
even if you know it s a mistake ? he has the better claim to the throne
"if i have failed you , my queen , forgive me"
"happen if you told your sister ? i don t want it , and that s what i told him"
whose fault is that ? mine ? what does it matter whose fault it is ? thousands of children will die if the city burns
cersei s followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost
"if the city surrenders , they will ring the bells and raise the gates"
"please , if you hear them ringing the bells , call off the attack"
"if not for yourself , if not for her , then for every one of the million people in that city , innocent or otherwise"
"then i suppose i ll die tomorrow , if not before"
"if the winds are kind , you ll make it to pentos"
"if you don t , you ll never see cersei again"
"if it works , give the order to ring all the bells in king s landing and open the gates"
"if daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood , maybe she ll show mercy to the person who made that possible"
"if it weren t for you , i never would ve survived my childhood"
"father my son ! soldier get inside ! man just ahead of you , i can see it ! soldier all right , move it ! woman come on ! soldier keep moving ! soldier keep going ! soldier keep moving ! soldier quickly ! soldier all the way ! man come on ! man come on ! father hold your mother s hand ! soldier make way for the golden company ! soldier close the gate ! if you hear the bells ring , they ve surrendered"
if you kill another king before you die they ll sing about you forever
if i win i ll bring your head to cersei so you can kiss her one last time
and you ll be dead too if you don t get out of here
"if you stay here , you ll die"
nothing else matters
nothing else matters
ominous music plays tyrion lannister cersei s followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost
"if the city surrenders , they will ring the bells and raise the gates"
"if you believed that if you truly believed it , wouldn t you kill whoever stood between you and paradise ? jon inhales deeply"
what about everyone else ? all the other people who think they know what s good
"if you look outside the walls of your city , you ll find thousands of northmen who will explain to you why harming jon snow is not in your interest"
"am i saying that properly ? if it weren t for you and your men , we would ve lost the war with the dead"
"but i ask you now , if we choose you will you wear the crown ? will you lead the seven kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day ? why do you think i came all this way ? to brandon of house stark i say aye"
"it would be really cool if youse got to meet him , he d be so excited"
finlay i was wondering if i could follow your fitting
if you could fill in that
"if i recall , the best way into that s on your knees , yes ? man it s the easiest"
"yeah , if they ve not read their more you know , because we ve given them to them , it s up to them if they want to read them before coming in"
i told you what would happen if you betrayed me
"for a moment , neither moves , as if moving will make this real"
"i know it s not mine , but don t waste it , you know ? finlay what are you gonna do if it snows ? if it snows ? oh , probably have a party"
"if it snows , yeah , cover the whole lot in white"
"liston if that s horse feed , it needs to come up to me at the horse marquee"
if you touch the paper at the wrong time it will dissolve like mission impossible and burn up
if we could give david a little privacy for this first rehearsal please ? thank you
"samwell if it s not too much trouble , i could use a pardon"
i offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee
"if i can pull the sleeve up , its happy days , if i can t , we ll rethink"
"if you cut through there and there , it s never going to go through a sword would never"
if they re all having their pints hey ! aah ! ha ha ha
"if it looks a bit skanky , i ll have the chicken"
sapochnik i think one of the things to take into this let s do the whole scene as if you both got stomachache
"like , if you took battle of the bastards into hardhome to the loot train , if you put all those three together that s probably the size of this episode"
he called me and he asked me if i would like to be night king
"woman is he heavy ? sarah it is a heavy wound , even if it doesn t say heavy wounds"
see if you can take them all
see if we can get all of them
it wouldn t have felt the same if we didn t
"i can t really say anything else , cause it s snowing"
"and if it snows , well , we can t just dress on top of real snow"
"if anybody dies , let me know"
"furdik when i read this , if it was up to me , maybe it would be good when bran will kill me"
if i m part of the actors or i m part of the stuntmen
"if anybody ever says how s it going , sarah ? i feel like saying laughing"
"it can only get so i m really disappointed , if we re still here at"
"we have the waif coming in , because so many people think that arya is dead and the waif killed her"
"i would like to see if they recognize who i am , you know ? both laugh"
"it doesn t matter how good he is , you know ? if their blood gets up"
"if you saw my apartment this morning , you d see that , uh , that didn t get any preparation at all"
"if you guys can all meet him there nutter i get pretty tired , but i get invigorated too"
"in college , i realized that wasn t gonna happen for me , so i said to myself , what else can i do ? and realized that my desire to move people emotionally , i could do it by being involved in filmmaking"
"i think if it wasn t for you guys and your morale , that s really what has got us through"
"i was like , you ll never get a part if you look like that"
it s as if it s day
yeah ? i can get you one of them if you want one
we don t care if they die
if the unsullied are pointing their spears at him we re not happy with that
"caulfield if people have game of thrones on their credits , people know that person had to work really hard , that person knew what they were doing , that person created , you know , a magical world"
"if you could see it , well done to you"
"well , it matters to me ! if i let go of my hair , my head will fall off"
"push her down the stairs ! push her ! push her down the stairs ! come on , daddy , listen ! all my life , everyone s always told me , you re a shoe ! you re a shoe ! what if i don t want to be a shoe ? what if i want to be a purse ? or a hat ? no , i don t want you to buy me a hat ! it s a metaphor , daddy ! you can see where he d have trouble"
if you don t want to be alone tonight
"that is why we don t do it ! i don t think that was my point ! know what s scary ? what if there s only one woman for everybody ? i mean , what if you get one woman , and that s it ? unfortunately , in my case , there was only one woman for her"
grab a spoon ! i don t know if i m hungry or horny
even if i could get it together enough
"if i can make coffee , there isn t anything i can t do"
"i think it s , if i can invade poland , there s nothing i can t do"
if you feel like you have to make a western omelet or something
"if i don t input those numbers , it doesn t make much of a difference"
or else i m going to get up and go to work
"you d be too , if you found these boots on sale"
"if you listen closely , you can hear a thousand retailers scream"
do you think it would be okay if i asked you out sometime ? yeah
you won t know a butt if it bit you
"but if i m not comfortable with it , i don t have to be involved"
"boy , if you could , i d want yours"
if it s a boy
"minnie , if it s a girl"
if you tilt your head and relax your eyes
"and , min , you know , if everything works out"
"all right , when you re finished , it s cool if you flick it"
"if i kept it , i d be stealing"
"but if you spent it , it would be like shopping"
"even if i was happy and skipping , i d hear not not mine"
if they never get to meet the guy
"if that s how you feel about the guy , dump him"
if only he were a woman
"lamb chop ! how old is that sock ? if i had a sock on my hand for years , it d be talking too"
"is there somebody else ? no , it s just"
"no ! i don t care ! i m weak ! i ve gotta have the smoke ! if you never smoke again , i ll give you"
"all right , phoebe ? if i were omnipotent for a day , i would want world peace no hunger , good things for the rain forest"
"what about you ? if i were omnipotent for a day , i d make myself omnipotent forever"
what would you do if you were omnipotent ? probably kill myself
"excuse me ? if little joey s dead , then i got no reason to live"
they wanna see if you re okay
"they wanna know if i m okay ? okay , let s see"
"and it s not even for me ! if that sounds like i m okay , then tell them i m okay"
"but monica , what if it doesn t come together ? pheebs ? well , because you just i don t like this question"
"see , you guys ? what if we don t get magic beans ? i mean , what if all we ve got are beans ? get him ! get him ! get him ! yes ! you re not laughing now , are you , pal ? all you needed were guys hitting each other with sticks"
excuse me ? it says to call if you re not satisfied with this candy bar
"if you want , i ll do it with you"

"but if you don t help , i m gonna take those hot dogs and create an appetizer called pigs in ross"
"and if i couldn t see that , we should cancel the wedding"
"if george and adelaide can t accept that , then the hell with them"
if my parents didn t want me to marry you no way that would ve stopped me
"and the fact that they re both monkeys ? i wonder if i did the right thing , giving him away"

what if her name was big ugly splotch ? where you getting it ? on my shoulder
why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life ? what if it doesn t come out right ? it s like having a bad haircut all the time

"if you care about me , get the pie out of the man s hood"

"yeah , but if i do tell him , then he s going to hate myself"
"then if that doesn t work , then we can go back to you know what ? forget it"
"if you can t get it out , you can cut around the stain , add a little lace , you make a stylish throw"
"you re taking this all wrong , because if i didn t leave you that tip , you wouldn t have come down here , we wouldn t be having this argument , and there wouldn t be this , uh , heat between us"
"we go out , we eat , and if you don t have a good time , i give you ten grand , we call it even"
"you know what ? ii came to you cause i thought you d understand ! oh , no , i you know ? oh i would storm out of here right now , if i had some money or a place to go"

maybe if it had more heat
"awkward ? why should he feel awkward ? you didn t tell him not to call me , did you ? if you re uncomfortable with your friend dating me"
"that s what you re worried about ? if that s the problem , we ve got no problem"
"i was gonna tell you over dinner , but i met somebody else , on my trip"
you said there s somebody else so she d work with you
"if you spend time together , maybe something might happen"
"you know what i found out ? if they can t find a home for her , they kill her ! i won t let that happen to little jasmine"
"i mean , if that s really what you want , okay"

"if i had known that you two , i never would have"
you know what else is great about him ? what is the word for an adult who doesn t have dinosaur toys in their bedroom ? what was that ? monica knows
i d really appreciate it if you d wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep
"if that s too damn difficult for you , then the least you could do is pretend"
"there you go ! that s the spirit ! if you need money , i will lend you money"
it s worth it if it ll get you moving
"she s really going to love this , you know ? the bottom line is , i want her to have it even if i don t get to be the one who gives it to her"
"so just let me know if she likes it , okay ? you got it"
"we are not leaving here until we are paid every penny , because we re part time caterers and we have no place else to go"

i just wanna see what else is out there
"no , i mean , if i can help"
you can watch the parade if you want
"but can t you hear him out ? if chandler had kissed rachel , would you hear him out ? that s a good point"
you ve sentenced him ? don t do the crime if you can t do the time
but if you weren t my best friend
"if you re not going to stay for me , then at least stay for them"
"if i knew what kind of friend you d be , i wouldn t have worried"
if we still had that unit i d get in it for six hours and think about how i let you down
like a pirate ? if that helps you
"if it were greek , i d be blind in both eyes"
ls he okay in there ? he s fine ! if things work out between you and richard s son you can tell your kids that you slept with their grandfather

"do you want me to quit ? what makes you think that ? those things you said in the interview if you believe them , i must not be a good assistant"

"and so what if i like to go home , put on kenny g and take a bath ? we re"
i guess if you don t want to deliver you probably don t want to pick up stuff either
"imagine , if she d just stepped off that curb a few seconds later"

"if it were any other job , i would"
"if she s no fun , why date her at all ? i want to give her a chance"
"and , at the end of the date , she said something that if she was kidding , was very funny"
"if she wasn t kidding , she s not fun"
"you didn t tell him that , though , right ? you told this guy that i was looking for a fling ? you don t tell him that ! why not ? i d be thrilled if some hot girl i see"
"and i don t deserve to have marinara sauce all over me ! if you want me to quit this bad then chef geller ? you know that speech you made ? i got a problem with it ! you do ? you bet i do ! i just wasn t listening then , that s all"
"if you want a problem , i ll give you a problem ! what are you going to do ? fire me ? you bet i ll fire you ! get out of my kitchen ! get out ! all right"
"anybody else got a problem ? how about you , chuckles ? you think this is funny now ? what if i dance covered in sauce ? you think it s funny ? no , it s really good"
"they say that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm , her egg , put it together in a dish and put it into another girl"
we were wondering if you could be that girl
we don t have anyone else to go to
"and if you say no , we ll totally understand"
and we were wondering if you could give us a ride down to the train station
"if you decide to do this , we ll be supportive like crazy"
and i really don t i don t know if anything i said would make you understand the pain of giving up a baby
"and if i save him a seat , he will sit in it"
"if that means we can t be friends at work , so be it"
you might if it were like seven
if he ll sit with me
if i can t give him up there s no way i can give up a baby
what else can i give them ? a kidney ! we were in the neighborhood
"if there was something you wanted to say , we ll be right there"
"what if i asked ? oh , mon , sure ! really ? yes"
i m going to the doctor and see if i m ready to have frank and alice s embryo transferred into my uterus
how will they know ? they ll just see if my endometrial layer is thick
"what s that about ? and you ! ross , if you check rachel s bag you ll find a half eaten box of cookies in there"
"that s it ? ? that means that it s , like , i was thinking , what are the odds if you stuff of them in there ? sweetie , now she s a woman , not a gumball machine"
"the lrish jig guy ? his legs flail about as if independent from his body ! gentlemen , your pick"
"next time you see me , if i m screaming , don t worry"
"ladies , if you miss this , the game is theirs"
"i got it ! if we win , they have to get rid of the rooster"
"the duck too ! the duck doesn t make noise ! he gets the other one all riled up ! we are not all right , hold on ! if you win we give up the bird"
but if we win we get your apartment
"it s a bet ! bet on a bet and if you lose , you lose the bet"
"i hate this as much as you , but if it makes you feel better this is all your fault"
"you know , pheebs , if you sit there long enough , you ll be sitting in our apartment"
"if it says i m not pregnant , that doesn t mean i won t get pregnant"
"but maybe if we keep that drawer shut , it ll die"
if you could just throw your purses at it
"there s gravy ? if you have the big apartment , you have to deal with people coming over"
"we re watching the game here saturday night , if people wanna come over"
"if you re willing , i m all yours"
"if you wanted to punish them , you should have just made them hang out here"
"i was just wondering if you ? if you ieft your wallet at the store today ? we found a wallet , and we the license ? that is a good idea"
"and if not , can i go ? what the heck is that ? did she call ? no"
"well , yeah , but , you know , what if i was wrong ? how might you be wrong ? what if she didn t actually sleep with the guy ? tell me she told you this"
basketball ! sorry ? i have two tickets to the knicks game if you re interested just as a thank you for this week
"if i had called her , she never would have gone out with nick"
"well , if she thought they were on a break"
"ever ! from now on , this chair is the one ! you know what else is the one ? my sweatpants"
the wouldn t it be great if she were my wife ? rachel
"if i run , i ll make it"
if it ll help
"who s in there ? how you doing ? who in the hell are you ? would you believe me if i said i was kirk douglas ? put some pants on , kid , so i can kick your butt"
"maybe it would really , really help if you would just talk"
"what s going on in there ? and you know , if you want to cry , that s okay too"
candy ? she was so spunky ! i think if i were going to be with a woman it d be with someone like michelle
"wow ! if only more people knew ! all right , do you understand any of this ? no , i don t understand any of this electrical stuff"
"if you insist on it , at least let me help you"
"oh , my god ! look at this ! but there is a wire there ! it s connected to something ! i don t care ! the wires have come loose in your head ! if i could follow the wire , i d find out what it did"
so i had to invite him to a party if i wanted to see him outside of work
you didn t know ? why are you over here if joshua s over there ? i m trying to play hard to get
what are the odds ? that s enough ! let s let someone else play
"if you didn t want to play , then why d you come to the party ? all right , i ll go"
"if it kicked once , it ll kick again ! everybody just remember where they were sitting"
if you re gonna do something wrong do it right
"what if i even things out for you , meat wise ? what ? i eat a lot of meat , right ? but suppose , until the baby s born , i laid off it"
"there s no meat in beer , right ? we can still make dinner if we skip the appetizers and ask for our check right away"
"if these walls could talk , they d say want to hear some memories ? need a hand ? i got this all under control"
what was supposed to happen ? can you not look at me when i say this ? i thought that if i could get you here i could seduce you
"if it makes you feel any better , i made a fool of myself"
you don t do that if you re just in it for two weeks
"if a cow died of natural causes , i could have one of those , right ? not if i get there first"
"imagine a protective porn bubble , if you will"
"if l get pregnant again , i have your card"
where you going ? to find out if he really thinks models are too skinny
"but if she doesn t call , it is definitely over ! unless , eventually , i call her to see what s going on and she says she ll call me back , but then she doesn t"
okay ? and someday that kid is going to ask me if i ever turned off free porn
if i hadn t let you talk me into this i wouldn t have put my fist through the wall
"if she doesn t show up , come home"
ask him if he likes it better than relaxi cab
"do you know where he is ? ross , are you there ? ross , i don t know if you hear this , but i ll talk anyway"
i wish i knew if you d heard me
"newman , if you re listening , bugger off"
"you want to see if we still have it ? free porn ! we have free porn ! there s one , two and three"
"anyway , since there are three babies and we both got to put our names in we would be truly honored if you would name the other boy baby"
"where is everybody ? they re hanging out with joey ! if you re going to name him joey , you should name him chandler"
"but with joey , if you need him , he ll be there"
and he ll bring you cold soda if what you need him for is that you re really hot
"if you hoped to sleep with joshua , which one would you wear ? it creeps me out choosing other people s sex clothes"
"then you realized if you bitched , then you would stop cooking and you would have to make your famous baked potato and diet coke"
how about a compromise then ? what if it s chan no ey ? joey ? think about it
would you feel better if we went someplace else ? we could pack this stuff up and go to your apartment
how s ben ? i asked if he wanted to eat
i asked if he wanted to sleep
you know what ? i never would ve gotten this if it weren t for you
"but we can t live in the small apartment after living here ! ever read flowers for algernon ? ever read sports illustrated ? no , i didn t read yours ! we can go to the game tonight ! the only way i ll consider this is if they offer more than just season seats"
what if you could keep the apartment and the tickets ? done ! let me finish
it would be different if it was way into the future and we were getting married
can you believe something that stupid actually got us our apartment back ? if you had just done that after the last contest no one would have had to move at all
even if they sit there until
"if you were getting married , i would feel kind of"
"you know what would make me happy ? you know , what s that ? if the four of us could all , you know , hang out together"
maybe i d have a problem with this if it wasn t for me and joshua
"if there was just one little area where i think we need to work on , i would think it s that we re just not crazy enough"
"what if we got married ? what ? oh , i know"
do you mind if i sit ? please
i don t know if we re going to be hungry at three
"if i died , people would know i was here only by the ass print on this chair ! what are we doing ? wasting our lives"
would it be okay if i asked you out sometime ? maybe
"look ! what ? top of the world looking down on creation and the only explanation i can find listen , missy ! if you want this cart , you ll have to take me with it ! did you see that ? you were incredible ! a brand new woman , ladies and gentlemen"
"if you don t get that i get that , but i m tired of your answering machine"
but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective
you don t do that if you re just in it for two weeks
you know what would be real weird ? if you weren t there
"if you re not going , then i don t want to go either"
drive her to the hospital if she goes into labor
if any of my friends ever get married or have a birthday or a tuesday
i wanted to apologize if i seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower
this guy offered to buy me food if i slept with him
"they said if i bother them again , they d call the police"
"what if we just called her used a fake name and had her come to my office ? that sounds like fun , but we got a ring to find ! here s your tea , phoebe"
and you know what else ? are they going to love you ! they are going to love me
you re so easy ! if anything happens to him the vet said it s a simple procedure
"what if he doesn t make it ? he will , joe"
but what if he doesn t ? he s such a good duck
"if you see a little version of me in there , kill it ! i got it"
"but even if , god forbid , you didn t , so you postpone the wedding"
if i was still in love with some still in love with ? i m not in love with ross
if you insist on wearing that in public you re gonna spend the afternoon all by yourself
"if you make me choose between you and the hat , i choose the hat"
she said what ? if i won t be happy with somewhere we d find in a day we should postpone it
"if you don t understand how important this is to me perhaps we shouldn t marry at all ! emily , no ! wait , stop ! emily , please did shopping help you feel any better ? manhattan doesn t have enough stores"
is this where you throw stuff in a bag with graveyard dirt and hang it from a north facing tree ? only if you have the hiccups too
"if it makes you feel any better , i ve had a really lousy day"
"but if you don t love this , we ll do it any other place or time"
"and , i don t know , if it rains then we ll get wet"
"i was wondering , please if it s not too much trouble , please might i speak with miss emily waltham , please ? miss waltham is at the rehearsal dinner"
"so if you don t give me that number , i m gonna come over there and i m gonna kick your snooty ass all the way to new gloukenshire ! hello ? hello ? she knew i could kick her ass"
how about and these earrings ? they prefer it if i don t barter
"this is kind of my little toast , or melba toast , if you will"
"if you re one of ross best friends , why aren t you here ? i can t fly"
"could we please just settle it after the wedding ? fine , but i m not paying for your wine cellar you thieving , would be speaking german if it weren t for us , cheap little man ! the guy was hammered"
"look , if i don t get to london he is gonna marry that other girl"
"if you re going to do that throughout the flight , tell me now so that i can take a sedative"
"and if i hear one more word no grandchildren ! that s right ! okay , okay"
"if you don t realize that , i can t help you"
"if you d seen a circus freak , you would ve said l take thee , circus freak"
"in the middle of everything , if i scream , yippee ! just ignore me"
what if we re watching a movie ? which we are ! and we ve paid for it
the room would be disappointed if it didn t get sex
"who knows what science will come up with in the future but what if i die an unsuccessful , regular size man ? you ve been in the bathroom for a half hour"
if i ever get a flight out of here
he kept asking me if i wanted chicken
and then i went to greece on somebody else s honeymoon
if you d stop thinking about ross you d notice there are great guys everywhere
i ll kick that door in if you give me some sugar
"rachel , i can do this all night if i have to ! you want me to get that ? no"
do you think it would be a good idea if i told ross that i was still in love with him ? nope
if nothing else it s always great when someone tells you they love you
if you get the babies out by month s end you get two percent financing
why don t you want to go ? why don t you give me a good reason and i ll tell you if it s true
"but if we re just goofing around , maybe i will go out with him"
"well , what else could it be ? it s kidney stones"
"lf it was something else ? well , that would be kidney stones"
"either we wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra no , no , no , no"
"i thought , why not goof around with him ? i don t know if you ve looked up goofing around in the dictionary"
but if you have this new dictionary that gets you mad at me then we have to get you my original one
so if ? know when to stop
"well , if you re going to cry"
"i don t care if i said some other girl s name , you prissy old twit ! way to suck up to the family ! i m so glad you re all here"
"you can hang up , but i ll keep calling everyone in england if that s what it takes to get you to talk to me"
i bet if i talked to carol and susan i could convince them to move to london with ben
"i gave birth to three children and i won t let them be raised in a world where joey s right ! can i ask you a cooking question ? if you re cooking on the stove that means your new boyfriend is better in bed than richard ? is he ? i think i ll respect the privacy of my new , secret boyfriend"
"why ? if this guy was me and it s me who d learned that it was me who was the best you d ever had i d be like this all right , emily"
i asked emily if she would come to new york
great ! only if i promise never to see rachel again
"if you ve been enjoying cirque du soleil and you d like to see more , it s very simple"
i don t know what else to do ! i either keep my wife and lose one of my best friends or i get divorced for the second time before i m
"if anyone else has a better suggestion , let s hear it"
"if i m the best , it s only because you made me the best"
"but when i m with you , and we re together oh , my god ! really ? oh , my god ! i understand if you never want to sleep with me again"
"we owe it to sex ! if we owe it ! oh , my ! when will joey be home ? i was kind of hoping we could do this without him"
i m just saying if you need to talk
you ll hate yourself if you don t
what if we went away for the weekend ? no interruptions
who knows what else they didn t change ? sweetie i just want this weekend to be perfect
but i have to do this if i want my marriage to work
"if anyone asked me to give up any of you , i couldn t do it"
i don t know if this falls under that category but ross is right back there
"pheebs , do you mind if i speak to rachel alone ? sure"
"what would you do ? if you were me , what would you do ? first , i d have said the right name at my wedding"
"if you always gave up after a fight you d never be with anyone longer than this isn t over ? you are so cute ! no , no"
"if you win , slap your opponent on the phoebe and say , hi , phoebe ! that s cute"
"wait , if we follow the rules it s still fun and it means something"
i m also sorry if sometimes i go to the wrong audition
if i pretend to not know about you then you pretend there s nothing to know
got if from my dad
how come ? everybody else does
"you re okay with that ? if i can just do what emily wants and get her to new york , it will be fine"
"i m not happy about this either , but if ross says he s happy then we have to keep our feelings to ourselves"
"if you want little round waffles , wait till i find the iron"
that guy is so rude ! really ! what is with that guy ? you d forgive me if i fogged you
he said he would cremate my fur coat for free if i bring in the next person i know who dies
but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature
are you saying that you re not entirely happy about this ? if emily gave me a choice you do have a choice ! why are you listening to her ? are you crazy ? it s not right what emily wants you to do
"she s totally stop pinching me ! you guys said to keep my mouth shut if ross was happy , right ? he just told me that he s not entirely happy"
i would have never fogged you if you hadn t looked so
"do you ? you know , if kids like to play with capri pants"
"why ? come on , you guys ! if emily knew i was having dinner with you , she d flip out"
it would mean a lot for me if you stay
it s almost as if he knew
this marriage will never work if you don t trust me
"the one where ross moves ln if every place were this clean , it d be tough making a living"
you mind if i wash up ? who knows where these have been ? you are just nonstop ! we re out of here
so if i said yes he d know i had nothing better to do than wait for his invitation
"did you know he taped over my baywatch tape with a show about bugs ? my god ! what if that had been porn ? all right , this may be tough but it s ross"
"if this guy keeps closing our favorite places , where will we eat ? i don t know"
"go , go ! if , after dinner , you still need to bust someone i know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose"
"i have to go downstairs and back up , as if i m coming home from the gala"
tell me if something bothers you
is it there ? is it not there ? are you aware that you re still talking ? is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong ? i don t know
if the parade decided it was gay and abandoned its family
"listen , if you and chip do it tonight promise me you ll tell me everything"
"right , clifford alvarez ? listen , roland cheng if things go well , i may be out with her all night"
maybe it d jog your memory if you guys played a little bit of emotional knapsack
"first of all , if you keep calling it that , no one will take it"
"and if i get a little hot , i can just dab myself with it"
"and , you know , if i get really hot i like to pick up this knife"
does anybody else just take off their underwear when they re hot ? what are you reading ? wuthering heights
"anyone else ? symbolism ! and the wildness of the moors which i think , is mirrored in the wildness of heathcliff s character"
i ve been wondering if you d ask me out
"if you re talking about feminism , i think you re right"
"which , if i may say , right now is out of control"
"he s always like , your colleagues will like you better if you like yourself better"
"how else would you explain all the weird stuff that s been going on ? yes , it s true"
"if it happened once , how come we found your underwear in our apartment ? that was the underwear i was wearing that night in london"
"my god , monica ! are you sure you re not just a sex addict ? if anyone s a sex addict here , it s monica"
"i will , and i would appreciate if we all could just drop it immediately , and forever"
"that is , if you can resist me"
"she s a woman ! what can i say ? she nailed it ! is there anything else ? you ll just say no again , but gay porn ? happy holidays ! feliz navidad ! allo and merry christmas ! oh , thank you , sir ! here s some joy"
"what about those good will hunting guys ? be realistic , you know ? if i did write something what are the chances i could get those guys to star in it ? wait a second"
"you meddled in our relationship ! you had no relationship ! but i was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan ! oh , god , stop with the plan ! so what if you saw him with a girl ? that doesn t mean anything"
"if he relaxes , he ll get some work done"
"if you think fireball s relaxing , you ve never played"
"if you were a friend , you d be doing the same"
"so being a friend means being a jerk ? if it does , then you re an amazing friend of mine"
"want to go give them a project , ruin their day ? if they have a ball , you could stick razors in it and teach them a new game gonna need stitches ball"
but it would help if i could hear it
"what s the matter ? we wanted to kiss at midnight , but nobody else will , so"
really ? how come ? you know those special skills i have listed on my resume ? i would love it if one of those was true
"who , from what i hear , needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer , if you know what i mean ! maybe your resolution should be to gossip less"
"is ted koppel a gossip ? if ted koppel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs , i would"
auntie monica ! ross is wearing leather pants ! does nobody else see ross is wearing leather pants ? someone comment on the pants ! i think they re very nice
do you mind if i use your bathroom ? go ahead
"what color is it ? what difference does that make ? if the paste matches the pants , you can make paste pants and she won t know ! do you have a minute ? dude , what am l rachel s here , so good luck"
if this shirt is dirty
if i hang around there long enough someone s bound to leave a plane unattended
but if you found out on your own that would be okay and we could talk about it
the one with chandler s work laugh could i have a scone ? want to hear some good news ? ls somebody else gonna give it to us ? because you certainly don t seem like you have any
"your work laugh ? if you re going to survive this party , come up with one too"
you re sure there s just not anything else ? i m sure
"is there something you want to talk to me about ? no ! if there was , i wouldn t tell you"
"frustrated with you ! if we hadn t lost , they would never have invited us to dinner tomorrow"
"the throwing the tennis games , the fake laugh the see you later , bing ! not if i see you first , doug ! listen , i don t sound like some crazed , drunken pirate"
"well , if you had kept listening you would have heard me call him mister bigot"
coffee in a fight ! you mind if i read my comic books in here ? sure
no strings attached ! if you can t remember that we should write it down
"i just didn t know what it was ! if it hurts that bad , you should tell her"
"done ! if you want to look good , come to the store"
"if it were me , this guy would be in some serious physical danger"
"if you think it s a woman s bag , it s not"
"if anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they thought , who s the best ? they d have to go to you"
so you re saying that if there was an award for the best bad massage
"are you sure ? if she isn t , cremating her was a big mistake"
"would it make you feel better if i said that i was very , very sorry i left ? it doesn t matter what you say"
as terrific as i think you are with it i just don t know if the world is ready for you and your bag
"if he s moving , maybe i should try to get his place ! it would be so cool to live across from you guys"
"take it from me , if you re gonna pull tape off yourself , it s gotta be in one quick motion"
"what do you mean ? if they say they are doing laundry , we ll give them laundry to do"
are you okay ? if you really want to know i can t tell you this
we d better go if we want to catch that movie
like if i wanted something from joey i would strike up a conversation about sandwiches or my underwear
couldn t if i wanted to
"if he wants a date , he s going to get a date"
not if i kiss you first
we d appreciate it if no one told him yet
i wonder if it s time for you to rejoin our museum team ? that would be great
the one with the girl who hits joey you know what i just realized ? if you guys have kids we re having kids ? i call godfather ! you can t just call godfather
if you cared enough to call it first
"if you want them to like you , why don t you just pay the ? the party will cost you more"
if you re afraid of a real relationship then don t be in one
"no , i m not ! if anything , i m making you look better"
"if she hits me when she is happy , can you imagine how hard she ll hit when i take away the joey love ? oh , right"
i thought if i kept insulting them you d defend them
what would you have done if i had said yes ? i would ve been happy because i would spend the rest of my life with the woman i love
it s just that if you wear someone s sweatshirt shouldn t it be your boyfriend s ? and i m not him
if chandler had said it you d all be on the floor
what if martin luther king had said that ? i kind of have a dream
"if that s what it was , that d be great"
who else is in vice there ? do you know sipowicz ? sipowicz ? i don t think so
if i can just get it to pivot we ll be back on track
"my god , it s him ! it s that cop ! i can t believe he found me ! are you gonna go to jail ? if i go down , you guys go down with me"
"i d love it if i weren t here ! since you re not going to jail tonight , i was wondering if you d iike to go to dinner with me ? me ? ever since you flashed my badge i can t stop thinking about you"
"it s the perfect job for me ! if you nail the interview , you ll get it"
"he said something about a boat and i was like , well , yeah , if you ve got enough life jackets"
you kissed him ? i didn t know what else to do ! you could have tried not kissing him
what if he thinks i ll just sleep with him ? he wants you back because you re right for the job
"now , look i m sorry if i gave you the wrong impression"
if you re going in there to see mr
then why did you ask us if we wanted to go ? because i just wanted to know what you were doing so you wouldn t walk in on me and chandler while we were doing it all night
"oh , god ! would it be inappropriate if i gave you a hug ? well , how about a handshake ? oh , god ! i m sorry ! i did not mean to touch that ! i mean , you ! there ! i m gonna leave"
are you tired ? you better believe he s tired after the day we had ! if you know what i mean
"and if i did , i don t think we d be going out"
"since you work at ralph lauren , can you get me some shirts ? i don t know if i d feel comfortable stealing on my very first day"
"if anybody gets free stuff , it s me"
"if we throw her party on her birthday , it s not a surprise"
wouldn t it be great if i got to play ben s dad ? you look nothing like ben
"what if this keeps happening ? they ll be smoking , making the decisions and i ll be up in my office breathing in my stupid clean air"
"if ben gets this commercial , do you think you can get me some free soup ? chandler , a can of soup is like cents"
is it okay if i leave this here till rachel s birthday party ? sure
didn t get a whole lot else done
"if anyone should step aside , it should be ben"
"damn it ! so i think that if we get these samples into the magazine by monday , we ll be fine"
"if you started smoking again , you could have at least told me"
"if i catch you , you re fired"
i just want you to know that if we ever cohost a party together again you can do whatever you want
he wondered if one person would be enough
"how d you get in ? made a few calls , pulled some strings and they ll seat us if we both have chicken and don t get dessert"
"if that was true , gym class would ve been more interesting"
if anyone should be hitting on her it s the guy who s single the guy who can do something about it
"if you said , big lima bean bubbling up , would she know the difference ? what are you doing ? oh , i just can t watch"
"by the way , if it makes you feel any better i happen to like what ? your hair"
it ll kill my grandmother if she finds out
"if we keep talking this way , won t we freak her out soon ? soon"
"all right , what can you do ? if you lost it , you lost it"
"if it s not that , it s my sweater"
"and if it s not that , it s my sunglasses"
"if you really like this girl , i don t think flirting is the right way you ll see"
"if this is how all the gellers flirt , we don t have a problem"
"what else do they add smell to ? caitlin ! caitlin ! hi , i m rachel"
"well , if he s so great why don t you go out with him ? well , you know , at some point you and i may need to have a longer conversation"

"so if you re looking up , say birthdays and dogs , you get photo"
"while you re at ross , if you see any lying around"
so all we had was ice ? see if he has ice
and i m wondering if we made a mistake giving up so fast
"but if you are , call me tonight"
"but if you are , call me tonight"
"what if ross hears that and calls her back and they get back together ? is that what you want ? ross back with that controlling neurotic , crazy emily ? the emily that wouldn t let him see you ? no ! oh , no , no"
what is it ? it just says you can t sue if you scrape your knee or get your head blown off
"if you want to be rational , i can t argue with you"
"yeah , if the car that backfired had run over you ! i m gonna go home , before ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life"
"you know what ? if i heard a shot right now , i d throw my body on you"
"like , if i was in a war"
if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches
"wouldn t it be great if we could go for two hours without dropping it ? yeah , it would ! let s do it"
"are you crazy ? are you insane ? if you live with phoebe , you two are gonna be living together"
"what are you doing ? i m trying to open your eyes ! if you live with phoebe , she is always gonna be there"
"if he asked me , i d move in with him"
"if you re not moving forward , you re moving backwards"
"no , if you re not moving forward , you re staying still"
"if something opens up , we ll move in"
if it has a pool
"but if it s too soon for you , we don t have to do it"
"what ? anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else s she , like , freaks out"
"i mean , we re gonna have to reschedule ! if you thought that this mess was gonna bother me , you are wrong ! all right , let s go , blinky"
"which route should i take ? the north or the south route ? if you take the north route , there s a man with a beard of bees"
and to see if you guys would place a little bet for me
anyone wanna say bye to me at the car ? i ll say goodbye to you at the car if you don t mind the pus
"phoebe , are you mad at me or something ? if you are , please tell me what it is i did"
"if you can t remember , can t we just forget about this ? oh , no"
is that all right if that stays in there ? i don t see why not
you don t want me here ? not if you re like this
"stop ! stop ! stop it ! damn , it s empty ! if joey and chandler walked in now , we could make a fortune"
he was wondering if i guess he ran out of change
how am i gonna apologize to him if he won t even talk to me ? send him something
"if i can t do it on the phone , i ll go and do it in person"
he asked me if i wanted to go for a bite and i did
"or am i ? love to love you baby love to love you baby love to love you baby darn it ! may i come in ? yeah , if you want to"
i won t go through with this if it ll raise the question of us
"i m working here till it starts up , if it ever does"
"if you act like this , i won t be around you"
"can you believe that ? if i won , i d join a gym"
"if you don t want me to see richard again , i won t"
what ? what else did he say ? he said he thought i was funny
"if you get this , we buy everybody a steak dinner"
"so if an eight comes up , we take it as a sign and we do it"
you know what else ? we would like some more beers
can t sit here if you don t play
"wouldn t you pay good money to see identical hands showcased in some type of an entertainment venue ? if you leave now , i will chop off my hand and give it to you ! didn t i just throw you out ? no , you threw out phoebe"
"if i can t do it on the phone , i ll go and do it in person"
he asked me if i wanted to go for a bite and i did
"or am i ? love to love you baby love to love you baby love to love you baby darn it ! may i come in ? yeah , if you want to"
i won t go through with this if it ll raise the question of us
"i m working here till it starts up , if it ever does"
"if you act like this , i won t be around you"
"can you believe that ? if i won , i d join a gym"
"if you don t want me to see richard again , i won t"
what ? what else did he say ? he said he thought i was funny
"if you get this , we buy everybody a steak dinner"
"so if an eight comes up , we take it as a sign and we do it"
you know what else ? we would like some more beers
can t sit here if you don t play
"wouldn t you pay good money to see identical hands showcased in some type of an entertainment venue ? if you leave now , i will chop off my hand and give it to you ! didn t i just throw you out ? no , you threw out phoebe"
why else would we be here ? what happened ? did we miss it ? we missed it
maybe you wouldn t have if you could run in the chapel ! this is insane
"what ? if you marry in vegas , you re only married in vegas"
"if you marry here , you re married everywhere"
how about if you come with me ? it s a long trip
"and if she s anything like me , she s just gonna be relieved"
"if we were supposed to get married , there would be a sign"
you can t win if you don t ask any questions ! what ? you promised me a fun road trip
"i don t know if that s true oh , but it is"
"when that happens in a marriage ross , come on ! this is not a marriage ! this is the world s worst hangover ! ross , listen , if you do not get this annulment , i will"
"it s been three days , and it drives me insane ! jeez , relax , it s not like we re mar you know , i was thinking what if l"
what if all my stuff was here ? then you d be going back and forth all the time
"what if we live together , and you get what i m saying ? live together ? there ve been no signs for that"
if you re gonna move in with him
"oh , that s good ! but if you were pregnant , what would you name it ? hint , phoebe"
"if you see her , give her some really bad news , so mine doesn t seem so bad"
"but wouldn t you date him ? and if you wait right here , i ll go get ross"
"if this is what you think , forget about"
what about this ? who gets this ? i don t know if i want it because it might be too many memories
would i do that if i loved her ? i ve never been more convinced of your love for her
"if she knew we were still married , she d have been more upset"
"did you , or did you not , smell her hair ? smell her hair ? what if i did ? ninety percent of a woman s pheromones come out of her head"
if the place you re referring to is being in love
"no ! no , no ! it would only be weird if we were still in that place"
"but if you think it ll be okay , we ll just work out a system"
which you will do if you move in together
"but if that s what you want , there s nothing i can do"
"merge ! i love that ! really ? no ! i found you in my bed how d you wind up there ? you are a mystery little black curly hair little black , little black , little black little black curly hair if you want to receive e mails about my upcoming shows"
"it s temporary , but if they like me , it could lead to a full time job"
"you know , if you can"
"if i go to the doctor , it ll be for this thing sticking out of my stomach ! that s a hernia"
"i m telling you , if i put my hand on my stomach"
if you could play it less intense
"you ready , joe ? one thing , is it all right if i scream"
so if we could just get back to the lecture
"so if you d just give me another chance to make a good impression ross ! are you crazy ? i am still your wife ? were you just never gonna tell me ? what the hell is wrong with you ? i could just kill you ! well , hello , rachel ! you ve really done this before ? you just take a big , big swing , okay ? now , don t hold back"
"if you think about it , it s actually kind of funny"
"sure , if you say you ll take care of it , i have no reason to doubt you"
"if you d had two failed marriages , you d understand"
what do you mean ? things ll go smoother if we each have a zone
"will you keep up ? if people see me just standing there , they re gonna think i don t own it"
i don t know if you re crazy or if this is some street theater
"if you were involved in a serious relationship , that creates a problem"
"if you don t wanna be together , file for divorce"
only an idiot would wear this stuff if he didn t have the car
and i thought it would be funnier if we got married
so then if you think about it
"i always thought if we got married , that d be the one that stuck"
not if you talk about how you gave up basketball to become a paleontologist
it doesn t count if you have to read them off your hand
"hey , remember the rollerblades ? you know what else i won t miss ? i m monica"
"i wash the toilets times a day , even if people are on it ! hi , i m rachel"
i ll stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy i find there ! we should get a move on if we want to make those dinner reservations
you re the one who wants this big change and move in with chandler ! you should go ! why do i have to leave ? it s my apartment ! it s mine too ! what else you got ? how about you re moving ! this is ridiculous
what else ? when i take a shower
what if i bought it from you ? then your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price
at a fake game ! if you wanna try to make some of it back
i assume the saucer card came up when you played last ? let s see if it comes up this time
"i mean , if you date her , then i can t date her"
you know what else i ll do ? i m gonna go downstairs and get her some flowers
if i could run
she won t care if i put her stuff back in the same stupid place
"if i want something done right , i have to do it myself"
what else ? they don t like you correcting their grammar
they don t like it when you keep asking them if they like you
"right ? believe me , you d feel a lot different if i turned it on"
this feels great ! and you don t care if people stare
"i m supposed to ask every guy i make out with if he s married ? no , yeah , i should"
i don t know if she s a famous artist or not
"if she finds out that i lied to her , she ll hate me even more"
"maybe if your skin was lighter , your teeth wouldn t look so bright"
if we put just a little bit of makeup on you whoa ! we re not anymore
"ross , i was wondering if oh , my god ! where are all the men ? hi , kim"
if you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan
"what if kenny were the real brains behind the whole company ? what if kenny hired that ralph guy to be the pretty front man , huh ? did she ever think of that ? you were with kenny today"
"i mean , if you want to"
"if you could not mention that we live together , that d be great"
"do you know why ? maybe it s because you re sarcastic or maybe it s because you if people don t know , they shouldn t just guess ! another thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for"
and there s none left for anybody else ! nothing
"if i mess this up , there s nothing else for dessert ? you won t mess it up"
who else is going to be there ? her friends
mom and dad sent me to find out if you were trying to get ross stoned
"and if you re gonna put your feet up leave him alone ! will you hurry up ? did you not hear me when i told you that janine s friends are dancers ? and that they re gonna be drinking a lot ? no , i did"
"do it faster ! i don t want to make any mistakes ! if i screw it up , everybody s gonna be like oh , remember that thanksgiving when rachel screwed up the trifle ? just let me worry about making it , and you just worry about eating it"
"if you don t tell them , then i will"
and if anyone needs help pretending to like it
"and then just dropped it on the street ? if it s any consolation , before the bird dropped it"
"joey , if you want to leave , just leave"
"and if she kisses me back , great"
"if she says , what are you doing ? i can say , it wasn t me , it was new year s"
"and everyone else , spread out"
"oh , that s it ? a great idea ? oh , yeah ? what if she gets you a great present"
"why would you do that to her ? why ? why ? if i help , we can find them faster ! right ! we have a live one ! oh , it s a macy s bag ! yeah"
really ? you d be better if you loosened your hips
"you two ! cool ! excuse me ? sir ? would it help if i weren t wearing underpants ? would it ? hey , tall guy ! i want to talk to you about that girl you re dancing with"
she s fair game if you ask me
if mom and dad don t see us on tv after we made them jealous
"yes , if the presents are hidden south for the winter"
"if you put that in her apartment , you ll never hear the end of it"
"if you come over tomorrow , i ll make pasta"
"and if she sees your table , she ll know i lied"
i don t know if joey told you
"my apothecary table ! what ? no ! where did you get this ? at pottery barn , okay ? oh , my god ! pottery barn has ripped off the design of our antique ! if they ve ripped off our table"
but i m not sure if we have the time
you don t think i know that ? i can t decide if it goes better by the new chair
"ross , if you ever decide to redecorate and i think you should you should ask rachel to help"
"are you saying you d move out if i didn t buy that lamp ? no , i m not gonna move out ! but are you saying that you would move out if i didn t buy that lamp ? yes ! i would so move out"
i m sorry if i was weird after the last time we went out
"they re like my family , you know ? if you guys are gonna be fighting all the time"
would it help if i apologized ? yeah
i d really like it if we could be friends
"but if it makes you feel better , they don t print the name"
"if you need money , would you please let me loan you some ? no , chandler"
want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch at his place ? sure
"if you had to pick one of us to date , who would it be ? i don t know"
"well , if you want , you can work here"
you know what else is wrong ? phoebe picking rachel
know who else picked rachel ? ross
know what else ross did ? he stole my joke
"i mean , the job s easy and the money s good , you know ? i guess if i m hanging out here , i might as well get paid for it"
"and if anyone is ever rude to you , sneeze muffin"
if you had to pick one of the other two to go out with
they said i can t work if i m sick
"if it s free , how come you re charging me for it ? don t give anything away unless it s a birthday"
what if they came in third in a modeling contest ? no
"but if i m going to bed , then you re coming with me"
"see , that would be impossible to resist if you weren t all"
"oh , no ! what if he marries her too ? this is just terrible"
what s up ? i just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front
"if it means that much , then i ll ask him out"
"if you ever date monica , you have my blessing"
"okay , if you really want to have sex"
"if she wasn t into me , why would she ask me out again ? she asked you out again ? yeah"
"what if you saw a three legged puppy ? i d be sad , sure"
"what if the puppy said , help me , chandler"
"god , if she would just stop moving"
i don t care if you can t cry
and if we have a baby one day
"and you don t cry , so what ? if we take him to college and go home"
"and then , you know , if i die"
is ross home ? maybe i ll call him and see if he s seen her who is it ? it s phoebe
i realized if anything happened with me and jill
i don t know if anything is ever going to happen with us
can you imagine if i d married him ? how different would my life be ? i ve always wondered how different life would be
if i d never gotten divorced
which time ? the first time ! imagine if carol hadn t realized she was a lesbian
from not doing anything else physical
"what if i was still fat ? you wouldn t be dating me , that s for sure"
"hey , imagine if i d never gotten fired off days of our lives"
"what if i had had the guts to quit my job ? i d probably be writing for the new yorker , being paid to be funny"
what if i d taken that job at merrill lynch ? what ? merrill lynch ? a massage client who worked there said i had a knack for stocks
i thought if i worked with stocks
"do you think if all those things happened , we d still hang out ? the one that could have been part gelula sdi oh , my god"
"can anyone else name a well known seed that s been masquerading as a nut ? oh , dear god"
"if i hire an assistant , would you take money from her ? no , joey"
"are you having a heart attack ? if i were , would i have shooting pains up and down my left arm ? yes"
most people d be excited if they didn t work for two weeks
"what else ? well , that is a large piece of television equipment"
"anything for you , sir ? did i not just tell him ? okay , look , chandler , if this is gonna work"
what if we were to
"you know , i think it ll be better if we just save it"
"pretty cool , huh ? but if you think a fish wouldn t get sucked into the mechanism"
if someone told me a week ago
"if this is too weird for you , you can still back out i got it ! thank you so much for coming"
"oyster ? if we did do this , there d be a lot of pressure on me"
"even if you were horrible , how would i know ? i do like that"
"well , if it helps , there were only three"
what if i turn out the lights ? that s the couch
"just okay ? did you do it right ? look , it s just , did you ever go to a party and think would anyone really miss me if i weren t here ? but still , ross"
"is joey tribbiani here ? if you see him , please tell him i m looking for him"
it helps if you ve got a little of this going on
"if we made reservations , we could have unagi in a half hour"
what if i forget to get you a present for that too ? you are totally and completely we ve got to wash that
she wants to see who else did
"but if you give me your number , i ll call you sometime"
"yeah , he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie"
"well , you let me know if you can"
he would kill me if he knew that i was doing this
you d really feel better if your friend could audition for my movie ? the heart wants what it wants
"you got me the audition ? let s hug it up ! okay , okay ! what are you gonna do to me if you get the part ? hey"
anyone else ? bring em on
"i was wondering if i could talk to you for a moment ? yes , of course"
"well , what if she gets upset ? then you distract her with a barbie doll"
if you pick my guy
"what if she goes down there and then sleeps with a bunch of guys ? well , maybe you don t marry this one"
"look , i don t know if your plans are finalized yet , but l know another great way to blow off steam"
"well , if what s in the bottle is actually"
i ll do it without you ! i don t need you or anybody else ! i m gonna make it on my own ! you ll see ! you ll all see ! the one with mac and c
"so joey , if you get this , you re gonna be , like the star of your own tv show"
my own tv show ? i don t know if i m good enough
i don t know if you d understand
"you threw my sandwich away ? my sandwich ? my sandwich ! it s just , i want this part so much , you know ? if i don t get this part , i m never gonna eat macaroni and cheese again"
and we would have you over all the time if it weren t for monica s allergies
"i mean , is it okay if they come visit ? what about my allergies ? right"
"how cool would it be if you could watch like a real life size version of this ? i mean , how crazy would that be ? as crazy as soccer ? hello ? what are you talkin about ? the audition s not til"
"if there was anything i could do , i would do it , okay ? but everybody s allowed one mistake , right ? he could have gotten me a vcr"
"so you got in voluntarily ? i was tryin to make a sale ! man , if i ever run into that guy again , you know what i m gonna do ? bend over ? there s lori"
"now , i will let go if you both stop"
"oh , my god ! look at me , i m chandler ! could i be wearin any more clothes ? maybe if i wasn t going commando"
"because the last one was such a big seller ? well , if you must know , i have written books"
it would really help me out if you guys could be here to make me look good
"i think if you give me one chance , i can change your mind"
"go back there and kiss some serious robot ass ! that s not a bad idea ! if i have to turn on the charm tomorrow , i m not wasting any of it on you guys"
"we said ! the only way that i said would be if i said the sentence , let s meet at , not at"
"if i had said , i would have said my boyfriend is such a wiseass"
"how are you ? joey , i ll get you your job back if you help me out"
"listen , i guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do"
"well , if you think about it ross did learn something from each marriage"
"and i have treated her with nothing but respect ! so if you ve got a problem with me are you yelling at me ? god , no"
"really ? well , if it doesn t matter to her it doesn t matter to me"
what if you get engaged in two years ? then you ve gotta wait another two years ? that s four years
"he s gonna find somebody else , you know ? someone who did put their name on the list"
"i mean , in two years , if you re not engaged , you just don t use it"
"if you re listening to this message , we re probably screening"
if she s still interested in having the bing geller wedding at our facility it is available
if she s still interested in having the bing geller wedding at our facility it is available
"okay , i ll go upstairs if you get me something from the car"
let s see if i got this straight
"if it really doesn t mean anything , because i m just not ready"
"should i get her a tiffany cut , or a princess cut or a paper cut ? ! have you told anyone else ? no , i don t want monica to find out"
we were just gonna see if you wanted to go
"if he s angry , he shouldn t hide it"
"i m just saying , if we re having sex , he s not talking"
if i m not buried with it
"if she says no , can i have the ring ? she won t say no"
"if ? hey , monica"
i just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight
"if you thought you d be cold , you should have brought a jacket"
"if you prefer , this table s available"
"plus , if you leave , my boss is gonna kill me"
"if school finds out , you re fired"
if you re not careful
"after seeing you , i knew if i didn t tell you i d always regret it"
only if you tell me chandler s willing to give you everything i am
"like if neither of them are married by , they marry each other"
"so if neither of you are married by , you ll marry joey ? yep"
"so what do you say we make a pact ? if you and i are both single by , we get married"
"stop messing with her ! and i would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn t keep flying off ! oh , my god ! i know ! they suck ! he s not supposed to ask her to marry him ! i am ! i know ! what ? you know what i ll do ? i ll go over there and kick his ass ! will you help me ? look , us getting our asses kicked is not a solution"
"if it bothers you , i can put my art out"
"remember my promise if we get married , three times a week"
"if it helps , it worked very well"
and can i give you a piece of advice ? if you do get her
"but if i were you , i would"
and if you let me
if you weren t here to celebrate with me us
"if you d let me finish , it goes on to say that he s probably not gay"
"if you get ready now , you can play"
"but if you touch my guitar again , i ll have to pound on you a little bit"
would you feel better if we stopped talking about ross and rachel ? that would be lovely
we ll see if they actually let you play
"yeah , and if you want to look , then you you got to do something about your eyes"
"whenever i get married guess who won t be asked to sing somebody named geller and somebody else named bing monica , your sweet was like a million years ago"
why else would you have made out with ross ? got me
it d be nice if i could have this night
"look , if we re gonna do this we re not"
it would be nice if they have privacy
i will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments
"what if i was sweeping a chimney ? joey , did you eat my face cream ? where are you going ? the vicar won t be home for hours"
"maybe , if your father hadn t tried"
but if you call our wedding a party one more time
"do you mind if i heat this on your loins ? you know , i cannot believe you told him"
and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy
"what else did you think about ? well , stuff like where we d live , you know"
"so you don t have to get us if someone wants to give us a present , we can t deprive them of that joy"
"if you don t sail it , what do you do on it ? it s a great place to just sit"
i could teach you to sail if you want
what s up ? my dad wants to know if you want to play racquetball
"what do you do if i say we re coming about ? i say , come again ? i know this one"
if you don t know what you re doing
if that is your father calling to tell this story
"joey , i m sorry if you thought that was mean"
it would have hurt a lot less if i had finished that last beer
i d feel better if you didn t tell what happened
"so if you ever see me giving them legal advice , just nod along"
sandwiches ! what else ? here you go
"if you re starting another story , at least let me finish mine"
"oh , hey ! can you hang on a second ? it s the producers at mac and cheese , if you ll excuse me for a minute"
if you ll excuse me
"if he s getting a divorce , is it a good idea to date him ? hey , divorced men are not bad men"
"you wouldn t mind if he was dating someone ? why , is he ? he is , isn t he ? he s dating that slut in marketing"
now if you ll excuse me
if she didn t bring the office home every night
and if that person s in your life you should do something about it ? yes
if someone else knew where everything was
"even if they break up again , you better not let him in your sad men s club"
"hypothetically , if phoebe were mine yes ! oh"
"if phoebe were mine , rachel would be phoebe s , i d be rachel s"
let s make it a double feature ? what else you rent ? die hard
"if i m your maid of honor , that means that you are monica s"
"well , if that s what you want"
what if i marry ross ? or joey ? you wouldn t
i audition and if i m the best of the people they see
it would make me feel better if louis apologized to me
i d love it if i could do both
what ? will you break up with me if i get fat ? what ? you broke up with julie
"what if i have babies , okay ? i m gonna look different"
even if i were to shrink down to inches tall ? i d carry you around in my pocket
"if you re monica s maid of honor , i get to be yours"
she asked me if the wedding was in town
"maybe if you gave her a chance , it would go somewhere"
if i m the only person with any appreciation
"not an issue now , but if we had kids"
i was just wondering if i could maybe stay here with you
"if we let her stay , she will stay forever"
"if you don t know them by now , you never will , okay ? that is the beauty of this game"
"okay , but if you can t , no dinner"
what are you doing here ? i wanted to see if your offer was still good
"extremely allergic , okay ? if i m anywhere near a dog for more than five minutes my throat will just close up"
"really ? if he s been here that long without a reaction , maybe you re not allergic to it"
"all right , rach , the big question is , does he like you ? because if he doesn t like you , this is all a moo point"
"lately , it s like , what if it s not ? do you ever have that feeling ? no"
which is why it would be great if you said something right about now
do you have anything else to say ? i can t believe it
"what if it attacks me ? chandler , it s like a big gerbil"
"if you said it like that , you did"
wouldn t it be easier if we just moved ? good morning ! somebody s in a good mood
"what kind of emergency ? well , what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says you ride this bike or i ll i ll shoot you"
"what ? what the hell ? you know what ? if you won t learn how to ride , then i m sorry i have to take it back"
and if you don t ride it you re killing its spirit
"if you care enough to make up that load of crap , okay"
"or , to use his full name , tag sweet cheeks jones ? is something going on with you two ? oh , my god , can you imagine if there was ? i mean , what would happen exactly ? well , i d be forced to file a report"
"if we know it , can we have candy ? all right , you know what ? forget it , you ve ruined it"
"if you could get us a table a bit quicker , i d appreciate it"
"hey , pheebs if you want to get joey a gift that disrupts the entire building why not something more subtle like a wrecking ball or a vial of small pox to release in the hallway ? it s not just the drum noise"
but if you re having so much fun over here it s so much more fun with you
"they say , if we want , we could see it tonight"
"because armadillos also wandered in the desert ? you want to wander in the hall ? hey , ben ! what if the holiday armadillo told you all about the festival of lights ? cool ! come on , ben"
"well , it would have worked this time if his hands weren t so damn small"
"no , why does he have to go ? because if santa and the holiday armadillo are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode ! merry christmas ! no , why can t the armadillo leave ? i want santa"
"if i hadn t stopped her , there wouldn t be a wedding to go to"
that doesn t give you the right to ditch me ! you can cancel plans with friends if there s a possibility for sex
"if it makes you feel any better , joan and i will just make an appearance and then we ll leave early as a sign of protest"
i didn t know if i should call
i really wanted to see you but i didn t know if you wanted to see me
"if i don t have my principles , i don t have anything"
and yet i know if i stop eating this i ll regret it
"maybe if i measure it pick a piece ! all right , i pick that one"
"no sharing , no switching , and don t come crying to me if you eat your piece too fast"
"well , now if you achieve distillation of subatomic particles before he does then he could come back"
i wonder if you can see my apartment
"it really makes you wonder , doesn t it ? know what else makes you wonder ? what ? check out the rack on that chick"
armageddon is what s going to happen to you if you wake me up

"because it s weird ! why ? what kind of a job is that for a man ? a nanny ? i mean , it s like if a woman wanted to be yes ? king ? i hope you don t mind"
"remember when you asked me if i was seeing someone and i said no ? well , i am"
"well , if that s what they do in minsk"
"look , david , if you had never left , then yeah , we d probably still be together right now"
"you are on a roll , mister ! if i d known you guys were coming over , i would ve brought more pizza"
"but if i ever do come back from minsk , well , you just better watch out"
"really ? well , if you do , come in the spring"
"if you want your key back , i totally understand"
"i just want to say , if you do ever come to minsk , that s my number"
"so if your maitre d friend has any funny oklahoma jokes tell him to e mail me at www dot ha ha not so much dot com ! honey , you can relax"
"although , if you don t mind telling me what was the problem ? maybe it s something i can work on in the future"
"you what ? you sang to our baby daughter a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses ? you know what , if you think about it it actually promotes a healthy body image because even big butts or juicy doubles are please don t take her away from me"
"it s a nice place , but i gotta say , i don t know if i see myself living here"
"even if it is , it can t possibly be as bad as what i m picturing in my head"
"can it ? see , in my experience , if a girl says yes to being taped she doesn t say no to much else , i ll tell you"
"but if i enjoy this , you have only yourself to blame ! why am i hearing cheering ? it s okay"
"you sang baby got back , didn t you ? nothing else worked ! that girl is all about the ass ! and then it goes back to the chorus"
"so what do you think ? so you stole that tape from richard s apartment ? listen to the judgment from the porn star ! that tape was never meant to be seen by joey , i would feel more comfortable if this conversation were in private"
"so what ? if i can get past that , it shouldn t bother you"
"if you can t even be civil to the woman i love the woman you what ? yeah , the woman you what ? the woman i love"
like if the queen of england comes over
what if something breaks ? they re expensive
what is the point of having them if we never use them ? okay
but if something breaks and then the queen comes over i will explain it to her
"sure , ross , yeah ! if i have a heart attack at a restaurant , i want you there with your fossil brush"
"ross , can i talk to you in private ? sure , you wanna go upstairs , or ? look , i was thinking , if it s okay with monica i would like to invite amy to thanksgiving"
"but she has nowhere else to go , and she s my sister"
"for example if you look at the ground when you talk , people know you re lying"
"you know what would be incredible ? if you guys died ! thank you , amy"
"phoebe ! why does she keep making that noise ? honey , i don t know how to tell you this but if something were to happen to ross or myself you wouldn t get the baby"
"hey ! how come my plate s less fancy than everyone else s ? do you not trust me with a fancy plate ? no , honey"
"okay , how about this ? if you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies then do i get the baby ? no , if crazy plate lady if monica dies , then i would get emma"
"what ? hurts , doesn t it ? who has to die for me to get her ? so if monica s not around , i m not good enough to raise emma ? no , that is not what we re saying"
"so if we both had emma , and i died she d have to give her up"
"but it did hurt my feelings , and i want you to know that if i die you don t get joey"
"forget the bubble wrap ! there isn t time ! frizzy , frizzy , frizzy ! shouldn t we stop this ? are you out of your mind ? let s throw some jell o on them ! gross ! all right , that is it ! this is our apartment , and you cannot behave this way ! if you can t act your age , you shouldn t be here at all"
"if i die and rachel dies and monica dies , you can totally take care of emma"
"you re my sister and if it really means that much to you so you re gonna give me the baby ? no , i was i was gonna let you use my ralph lauren discount"
like only if the queen comes ? maybe not even then
"if you go , we won t have a night together for a week"
so if you could just realize it on your own i know
so i think emma is probably down for the night but if you need anything we ll be fine
"what s going on ? i don t know how to tell you this , but i think monica s cheating on you ! i told you , you shouldn t have married someone hotter than you ! if you can t deal with this , then i m gonna"
"so , what if they do ? we re not here to meet guys"
maybe we could get your numbers and call if we find something fun ? yeah
"hi , listen , i know that this is a lot to ask , but you know what ? if you do this , phoebe will do anything you want"
then maybe you won t mind if me and my friend take a look around
"if you just got back from tulsa , how did your suitcase beat you here ? i climbed down the fire escape , and you can t put that in the closet ? so , with the exception of the fermentation process beer and ale are basically the same thing"
"it s hard enough not seeing you during the week but for christmas if this is what you have to do , i understand"
"so if you were home right now , what would you be doing ? typical christmassy stuff , you know"
what if she gets you a great present two medium presents and lots of little presents and you got her one great present ? that s gonna make her feel bad
"well , hey , ben ? what if the holiday armadillo told you all about the festival of lights ? cool ! come on , ben"
where s everybody else ? i sent them home
"and if she were here right now , she d kick your ass"
if what you and your wife have is so great then why are you spending christmas with me ? you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight
"i thought , why not just goof around with him ? i don t know if you ve ever looked up goofing around in the dictionary"
"if you have this newfangled dictionary that gets you mad at me then we have to , you know , get you my original dictionary"
so if ? know when to stop
"and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy , then then that s what we re gonna do"
"what else did you think about ? well stuff like where we d live , you know"
"i thought if you left , you d get fired"
"if you want , i could loan you some money"
"why does she have a pink bow taped to her head ? because if one more person says , what a cute little boy i m gonna whip them with a car antenna"
"so he said , if your puppy friend doesn t get her puppy act together i am gonna fire her mother puppy ass"
"she gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor because if she doesn t , people die"
"they said if i didn t come back today , they d fire me"
"i m just afraid if i don t come back now , this guy will try and squeeze me out"
i don t know what else to do
"yeah , but you have to give it back if i get a job"
"what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer and messes up all the ribbons ? what if there s no room for a ribbon drawer because the baby s stuff takes up all the space ? where will all the ribbons go ? should we go make a baby before you change your mind ? yes , please ! okay"
i don t care if you are my brother
"what ? you really think she s hot ? are you kidding ? if i wasn t married , she d be rejecting me right now"
"if it means that much to you , i ll get rid of bob"
"what do you care if i was looking at her ? are you jealous ? oh , yeah"
"about molly , i would really prefer if you didn t go after her"
"i m sure he ll lose interest in a week or two but for now , could you please just do this for me ? fine , but don t blame me if it doesn t work"
"you mind if i join you ? actually , i d rather be alone"
"monica , you think skippy liked you ? honey , all those boys had a bet to see if he could knock you over"
"so , what if each of them has seven rats and then each of those has seven rats ? that s like that s math i can t even do ! what are we gonna do ? well , i know this is gonna sound crazy but we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives"
"and you would have seen it if you didn t show up at again , you re welcome ! look , i ll just give you this and go"
if you don t mind ? let me
"i haven t seen it , but if i do , i ll let you know"
and i said maybe if we put some lights out there they will
"i saw rachel kissing some guy on your balcony , even though there were no lights ! so are you gonna talk to her ? why ? why should i ? i mean , if she wants to move on , that s fine"
"i mean , if she wants to date people , fine"
"but if she wants to go out there kissing guys she barely knows , then so will i"
"double standards ! before i forget , are you coming to mike s piano bar tonight ? only if i don t have to get up and sing"
it ll just be easier if it s two of us
"we were wondering if you re up for it , we only need six more people for a human pyramid"
"but , chandler , i don t know if i can take any more plucking"
"you know what ? if it s meant to be , i ll guess it"
"and even if they weren t when you walk in on a woman using a breast pump yeah , that ll do it"
"really ? sure , why not ? in fact , if you know anyone that d be good for me ? sure"
rachel asked me if i knew anyone for her too
"now if you ll excuse me , i have to get back to reading the obituaries"
"she s also in this phase where if you leave the room , she screams , but thanks , you guys"
what if we don t find him somebody else ? we ll just tell her the date s off but we don t tell ross
"go take the test , see if we re okay"
i might have checked to see if i was ovulating a couple times
"well , if i m still here in an hour , buy him a drink on me"
can i get you another glass of wine ? i don t know if i should
she may notice if we start canoodling in it
"so if you were thinking , well , he s not that good looking but maybe we ll have some laughs , that ain t gonna happen"
"if it was meant to be , it s meant to be"
"what ? ! you re making money off my misery ? well , if you stay till , i am"
"now , if you ll wrap up my free crab cakes , i ll be on my way"
"but is it technically a date if the other person doesn t show up ? oh , no"
"do you think she walked in , saw you and left ? why does everyone keep saying that ? if it makes you feel any better , i wish my date hadn t shown up"
"if i don t know who makes the most how do i know who i like the most ? hi , joey"
"you know , if i didn t already have a job i would ve been good in advertising"
i don t care if you think he s hot
"if you want to sleep with him , do it on your own time"
"if you insist on this i will call my agent so fast on a cell phone connection so clear , he s gonna think i m next door ! hi , thank you so much for whispering for my benefit"
please ? if you want to come back today here are my notes
"what are you doing ? putting on the sneakers to get in the young mindset , see if it sparks anything"
"but , you know , if you think about it , it s kind of neat"
although it would be nice if the thing that you loved was finding gold
"if there s one thing my father taught me , it was well , to always knock before going into the pool house"
i m gonna get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard
i d be lying if i said i hadn t thought about it myself
but don t you think it might be different with someone else ? perhaps a blond who always uses the toilet ? except for once in the ocean
"are you okay with that ? if not , maybe us moving in together isn t the best idea"
"because if we move in and you start changing your mind there is gonna be hell to pay , mister"
"if you don t , i will"
"now you re seeking me out to make jokes ? i mean , i can see if we re all hanging out , but to come to my home no , i really want to know how you feel about it"
"i mean , if you want to see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving get them married"
"seriously , you ? divorce o ? if you have to call me a name , i d prefer ross , the divorcer"
your ass ? ! and don t be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too
"if it means that much to you , i may be able to get onboard with the boobs but the giant ass and the big clown feet ? oh , my god , chandler"
"if you can t handle this , what will you be like in the hospital with the blood and screaming and the little person that s shooting out of her ? what ? joey , why did you tell chandler that monica was getting a boob job ? because she is"
"really ? all right , if that s what you want"
"okay , if mike were here , what would the two of you be doing ? what are you , animals ? it s in the afternoon"
"but look , if you talk to him , then you re gonna want to see him"
"and if you see him , you re gonna wanna get back together"
"think , monica , think ! look , if i want to see phoebe , and she this doesn t concern you ! sorry"
not if nothing happens
"if you re just gonna hang out as friends , then maybe i ll join you"
so that s what i d look like if i worked out
"i m sure if you had a funeral or memorial service , tons of people would come"
"but you know what ? if you need huggsy , don t worry"
"i mean , if if huggsy means that much to emma , then well , she can have him"
"i mean , if i had known the last time i saw you would be the last time , l i would have stopped to memorize your face , the way you moved"
if i had known the last time i kissed you would be the last time i never would have stopped
"kiss him , you fool ! what ? didn t you hear that speech ? if you don t kiss him , then i will"
"if he knew it was gonna be the last time hey , it was very moving"
"do you know if he s seeing anyone ? yes , he is"
and if heaven has a door i m sure he s pressing his ear up against it and listening intently
the fact that you re here means more to me than if this room were filled with people
"even if i had died , you would not be left childless"
and what else is it not ? a place to eat spaghetti
"yes , because if i was at my old job , we d say , million ? no , thank you"
"why don t we all pitch in bucks , we ll pool our money together and then if we win , we ll split it"
"don t touch the phone ! i ll get it ! you think he washed his hands ? hello ? hey , charlie , what do you know ? what s going on ? chandler s supposed to find out if he s getting a job at his agency"
if only it were a sure thing like your state lottery
"a psychic and a wishbone ? guys , give someone else a chance"
"i can t tell you what i m wishing for , or else , you know , it won t come true"
"but , you guys , just in case , maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp"
how are you gonna feel if we actually do win ? you re not gonna win
"so now that you re in , what are you gonna do if we win ? i don t know"
"i m hoping that if she hears it enough , it ll be her first word"
"although if we re gonna do that , we should probably call me daddy too"
"did anybody else hear ? what ? susan got it ? how ? oh , man , i would ve slept with him ! all right , bye"
we need to sort through the tickets quickly to see if we ve won
"if i win the lottery , you guys are not gonna leave me"
"believe me , if you win the lottery it s the last you re gonna hear from us"
then i want mine too ! and if i win i m gonna put it all into a very low yield bond ! no
"no , we should divide them up and i should get extra because we used my car ! hey ! hey ! if anybody gets extra tickets , it should be me ! this whole thing was my idea ! yeah"
"thanks for inventing the lottery ! just give them to me , and i ll split them up ! hey , hey ! god , i can t take it anymore ! i m putting an end to this ! okay , if she jumps , i get her tickets ! wait , no , no ! hey ! if we re not doing this together , we re not doing it at all"
give me a call if you want
"well , i guess if everybody else is"
you wanna come down to the set and tell me if i m doing okay ? are you serious ? yeah
"why don t you take ross ? don t you think that ll be a little weird ? i mean , two guys in a romantic inn ? no , not if the room has two beds"
"not that you need it , but good god ! is that chase lassiter ? he s straight , right ? rach , if you weren t here wondering if these guys were gay , i don t know if i could do this"
"we ll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if they re closed , then maybe we ll tap a tree and make some ourselves"
"is there anything else you have that i haven t asked for already ? yeah , go ahead , send up some tampons"
"hey , you know what else i could use ? there s this scene where drake sneaks into olivia s bedroom and she doesn t know he s there , which never happened with us"
"if i weren t doing this , i d just , you know , be at the gym working out"
"a professor spafford from cornell ? well , he s obviously late , and the rule in my class is if you can t come on time , then don t come at all"
"why wouldn t you invite us to your parties ? you re fine , okay ? but everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people"
"if you ll excuse me , i m going to use the restroom"
"and i don t know if you ve noticed , but she s a hottie ! hi ! hi , you guys"
"but if she s getting one , i want one too ! to monica"
"oh , man ! if i had known i was coming to this party i never would ve gotten married ! it was nice to meet you"
"dirk was wondering about the woman you brought and if you two are together ? well , no , but i mean , she only goes out with really , really smart guys"
let me see if i approve of any of these clowns
can you imagine if they had kids ? and if the kids got her intelligence and joey s raw sexual magnetism those nerds would get laid ! all right
"if we want to grab a bite before work , we d better get acrimonious"
i think it s a good idea to find out if everything s okay
"look , if you don t know what the word acrimonious means , just don t use it"
"if they re gonna shorten it , they should call it the muse , you know ? short for museum and avoid all the confusion"
just let me know if you need a hand
i wish i knew if that was right
"but what if it s not okay ? i mean , what if there s a reason we can t have a baby ? chandler"
"phoebe ! you know it s me ? well , for like a half an hour ! man , you can lie about sweden ! how can you come here ? why didn t you tell me you work here ? i don t have to tell you everything ! you do if you re gonna make me feel guilty for getting a free massage"
"now i m this corporate stooge and punching a clock and paying taxes ! phoebe , honey , if you hate it so much you should walk out there right now and quit"
"if you guys have microphones in there too , i didn t mean any of that"
"if it was good , you d have said , dr"
"if you have the time , i d really appreciate the help"
"if you feel that neither of those is right for you , you could always adopt"
"if i do , i d love for you guys to come and hear me"
"apparently , you only get porn if you re giving a sperm sample"
"but if they re off by even a , years or so then you can just throw most of our assumptions you know , right in the trash"
"i mean , not just in paleontology , but if you think about it in evolutionary biology , genetics , geology"
nobody else has a chance
who else ? anybody
"i mean , even if my sperm worked fine , i think he d be the way to go"
"oh , god , do you think she heard ? lt d be so bad if she heard"
see if you can hear me
"if he realizes that i m the one who put him to sleep , i won t get the job"
can we just talk about something else ? sure
let s just go over there and see if she heard
"if i don t show up , he ll think it s because of him and then i m gonna lose face"
it s just that when we were asking him all those questions before i just realized i don t care if he is the most perfect guy in the world
"if i can t get pregnant with you , then i don t want to get pregnant by him or anyone else"
"if we re lucky , and we re really , really , really quiet we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking"
"you wouldn t know if jeanette s planning on keeping her baby , would you ?"
if he gets too much direct sunlight he ll die
"see , if you want advice , go to ross or monica"
what if you let phoebe know you d be open to marriage ? that s great
will you wear a thong ? i will if you will
"oh , and see if they have a heart shaped one"
do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer ? sure
it ll be even better tomorrow because i won t be constantly interrupted by joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet
"if you want to check your e mail , just ask"
what do you do ? i usually go play tetris on somebody else s computer
"he s gonna propose ? i m sorry , did you say something ? i can t hear through all this damned hair ! if phoebe wants to marry david , she should"
meddler ! meddler ! if you hadn t meddled to start with then i wouldn t have had to go in and meddle myself
"hey , hey , hey , don t mind if i do"
"if you knew , why didn t you tell me ? i mean , call , leave a note"
"have you heard him talk ? phoebe , i would be honored if spit it out , david ! phoebe"
if the rain stops
"just so i know , if i had asked first ? yeah , i might have said yes , but that would ve been wrong"
"i mean , perhaps if i hadn t gone to minsk things would have worked out for us , and i wouldn t have ruined my career"
"is it okay if i hug you now ? oh , yes"
if you blow bubbles in his face he chases you
i ll find someone else to do it
"i d do it alone , but i don t know what happens if the sea turtle catches you"
i ll play if we don t keep score
"you want to volley a bit for serve ? sure , if you want to"
"standard rules if at any time a player uses his nonracket bearing hand to touch the playing surface , he or she forfeits the point"
"well , i m gonna go see if i can get a room for tonight"
"musings , if you will"
"if you ever want to get away from the city , well , that d be just nifty"
"i may not understand why you have to win so badly but if it s important to you , it s important to me"
if you blow bubbles in his face he chases you
i ll find someone else to do it
i ll play if we don t keep score
"you want to volley a bit for serve ? sure , if you want to"
"standard rules if at any time a player uses his nonracket bearing hand to touch the playing surface , he or she forfeits the point"
"well , i m gonna go see if i can get a room for tonight"
"musings , if you will"
"if you ever want to get away from the city , well , that d be just nifty"
"i may not understand why you have to win so badly but if it s important to you , it s important to me"
so if you want finally
"yeah , i hear someone else in there with him"
"honey ? if you know it through a wall , you know it too well"
"if you see him , could you tell him i m looking for him ? you got it"
it s almost as if air barbados doesn t care about your social life
"hey , rach ? yeah ? do you mind if i sit here for a sec ? yeah"
"nothing else happened , okay ? ross , ross , ross"
"dude ! hey , if there is ever anything i can do for you i can t think of anything"
and if she gets upset just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snap
"so if you want people to see them you re not having them taken out , say , at the break of dawn ? well , if i had them taken out , then i wouldn t be able to do this"
if you think about it i hate them
everybody else does
"if i untangle you , will you please get rid of the cornrows ? i guess so"
i think it s better if you tell him
"that way , you know , if he gets mad , all you have to do is go i didn t mean it"
"but if i hadn t walked in here , would you ? probably no"
if you two are happy then i m happy for you
"i ll cook ! look , don t you think that would be a little weird ? weird ? what ? what s weird ? the only thing weird would be if someone didn t like mexican food because i m making fajitas ! i do like fajitas"
"oh , how does it work ? i don t know ! if you re having a hard time , you should talk to my friends bill and colleen"
"but if it was up to me , this is not what we d be doing on our first date"
aren t you ? aren t you ? aren t ? you see ? who else is fine ? come on
i think everyone would feel better if we had some flan
how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them ? i m gonna go tell emma she was an accident
i wonder if i should get one
"if you didn t wanna get me on my mobile , then don t call me on my mobile"
"yeah , it could be rachel asking if someone could babysit again"
"if she asks , i protested a little , but okay"
"if not , we ll just be a couple that never has sex"
"gee , if only she were and had no idea what the hell a birthday was"
"but if we end up not doing this maxim thing because of this party believe me , that is not why we won t be doing that"
you know what would be fun ? if we gave this present to emma from all of us
"cause not much else rhymes with emma ! maybe the actor richard crenna he played the commanding officer in rambo happy birthday emma ! is that it ? no , of course not"
"and if you give them a photo , they ll copy it in icing"
"if i wanted this cake to be a disaster , i would have baked it myself ! is it okay that i still think it looks delicious ? jack , look at this"
and i need a bunny cake right now ! ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby s face off the penis so we could put it on the bunny
we seriously have to go if we want to get to vermont
"wait , if anybody gets to go , it s us ! we ve been complaining the longest ! no , wait , you guys"
"anyone else ? no , let s just draw straws"
"if ross and rachel ask , i ve been here the whole time"
"hey , rach , the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we wondered if you would write one for us ? of course"
"the one where rachel s sister babysits so , you know , i have a little time if you want to i d love to , but i really have to grade these papers"
i really appreciate it because i don t think i would be the person i am today if it wasn t for you guys
"if i were a guy and did i just say , if i were a guy ? you don t need him to propose to you"
"you pierced her ears ? doesn t it make her nose look smaller ? you pierced her ears ? how could you do this without telling me ? if i had told you , then it wouldn t have been a surprise , now would it ? i think she looks cute"
babies don t care if they re slim ! enter amy
"why ? well , if you don t hold it in , you don t get all the nutrients"
"it s in the cake , isn t it ? where else would lame mr"
there s no one else in the world i would ask to marry me three times
it s almost as if people don t want to hear that their babies are ugly
"and if i get it , i ll be able to complete my field research"
"so your ex boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant ? wow , your new boyfriend is screwed"
"if anything , i think this could help you"
"i just realized , if i do that , that means you don t get her"
"if you don t like it , don t pass it on to your bosses"
"if i suggest him , my bosses will think i m an idiot"
"if you say , no , then i m joking"
"if you had seen what was on this tape , believe me , you d have some comments"
"if you don t believe me , let s go talk to him"
"no , he did ask me one how do you spell boscodictiasaur ? well , if it s like the lake mbosco in congo , then m b o damn it"
how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at city hall ? i think it would make me wanna marry you even more
"if she doesn t like us , she can keep us off every adoption list in the state"
"because ? all right , if you must know , i had a traumatic swing incident when i was little"
and there s that moment when you re at the top when you just don t know if you re gonna return back to earth
"i don t know if you wanna use it , but oh , this is so sweet of you"
can we just get out of here before somebody else gets hurt ? no
where ? ! where ? ! if you hold a spider
if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time my friend hasn t shot anyone in a really long time
"if i had your number , why wouldn t i call you ? i don t know"
"if i haven t said so already , sir , congratulations"
"yeah , i d probably enjoy it more if you didn t keep batting my hand away"
"if we don t leave now , we re gonna be late"
i don t know if that s a good idea
"if i could just get in there , make a face to face apology iook them in the eye , i could get them to forgive us"
that would be a lot more convincing if you weren t drooling
"but just think , okay ? what if everything goes right ? what if this woman does pick you guys ? oh , my god"
"i know things could still go wrong , but if they don t if this works out , we re gonna have a baby"
"might be why i don t remember , huh ? do you think i m someone else ? look , i may not have treated your friends well in the past"
"if you want fashion help , rachel and i are going shopping tomorrow"
"you are calling her , okay ? and if you need to , then just get an extra plate of fries for the table"
"so you re saying if i wear these pants , i might be getting into hers ? why do men keep talking to me like this ? so the fact that i m a doctor and my wife s a reverend that s important to you ? yeah"
"well then , if there s nothing else , then the two of us should talk"
"now if you ll excuse me , i have a date"
"if you think about it , i m kind of like a reverend"
"i mean , who knows how long it s gonna take for someone else to give us a baby ? what if no one ever picks us ? oh , honey please ? please"
"if i can t have your clams , you can t have my dessert"
i could perform an operation on you and prove it if you d like
if you look at our file i don t want to look at your file
"if you had to , what would you give up , food or sex ? sex"
i know that monica is working today so i was wondering if you wanted to come to the movies with me and rachel
"if she asks you , i was at work all day"
"if one of us saw mike with another woman , would you want us to tell you ? why ? who d you see him with ? no one"
i m just saying if we did tell me what you know ! no one ! nothing ! mike s a great guy ! it was hypothetical ! all right
"if i did see him with someone , there s no way l who did you see him with ? oh , look at her"
if only there were a smaller one to clean this one
what if ? what if you want chinese food at a
"? or a fake rolex that breaks as soon as it rains ? or an asian hooker sent right to your door ? you know what ? if you want to look for a house , that s okay"
"i think if you saw it , you d understand"
"i mean , if you move there , you have to leave here"
"you re a shoe ! i stopped and said , what if i don t want to be a shoe ? what if i want to be a purse ? or a hat ? i don t want you to buy me a hat , l it s a metaphor , daddy ! you can see where he d have trouble"
"i got it ! if we win , they have to get rid of the rooster"

but if we win we get your apartment
what else ? when i take a shower she leaves me notes on the mirror
"if you had gone to vail or if you had been with your family , or if you didn t have syphilis and stuff we wouldn t be all together"
"yeah , and about this nancy if you re not sleeping with her , should i ? i know there ll be other houses , but i just i love that one so much"
"look , if you date wait ! wait ! what are we doing ? what we have is too important to mess it up over some girl"
"if i m building a house , the plan isn t called a shmooprint i can t do that either ? in high school , i once had sex with a girl right in the middle of the ? cafeteria ? yeah , but they re not looking for that"
"now , if you ll just pay me my , i ll be on my way"
it s not my fault if you re too uptight to appreciate the male form in all its glory
"if we re really gonna do this , it s not like you never broke one of the pacts"
"but if a guy who looks like corey haim wants to kiss me , i am so gonna let him"
i ll see if i can find ross
"no , there s got to be something else that you can do"
"and well , i would just really love it if you would do it"
"so , you know , you were if it helps , you were next in line"

what happened ? who cares ? and ? and i was wondering if one of you guys i ll do it ! me ! you both wanna do it ? there s only room for one
"well , if phoebe s choosing , then say hello to mike s next groomsman"

i think you and i will do much better if you re just here as a bridesmaid
"if that s really what you want , then here"
"i guess if you re taking over , then you should probably return these messages"
but if you pick chandler he s gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time
"mike , if you were swedish and you were saying the word lorkins , what flower would that be ? orchids ? right there ! that s why i m marrying you"
"if you pick ross , he ll walk you down the aisle just fine"
but if you choose me you ll be getting some comedy
"anyway , if i m the only one left out of this wedding i just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back"
"i thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog , chappy"
we have to find someone else to walk phoebe down the aisle
"oh hey , when she gets here , is it ok if i introduce you two as my wife and the woman who s carrying my child ? no ? divorce ? hey"
"well , if it annoys you so much , then why do you do it ? oh hi , thanks for showing up minutes late ! ross no no , i m sure you have a great excuse"
"ok , if you really need to"
"oh , wow , that ear and nose hair trimmer i got him was just money down the drain , huh ? miss green , your father s doctor is on the phone if you d like to speak to him"
let s see if we can get rachel back in here
"rach ! noo ! ok , maybe if we just break it down"
"they gave him a lot medication , ok , he wouldn t even know if you were there"
"and i just don t feel it will be right if i d like be , you know , taking advantage of you"
"well , is there anything else you want to know ? oh , uh , ok"
"do you mind if i ask you some questions about the father ? oh , sure , yeah"
"really ? well it seems to me if you ve done the right thing , i would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed , i would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied"
"if the baby is a boy , would you name him after my father jiminy billy bob ? oh , really ? noo"
but i think we re gonna go with someone else for the part
even if we want it really bad
"if you don t wanna leave , why are we having this lunch ? that is my boss what ? that is my boss that s hugo boss ? this place is so depressing"
if i had to work here i d kill myself
"if you love this house so much then you should just live here , ok ? i just hope you get used to that weird humming sound"
no one else has a name like it
no one else has a name like that
"if you love it , i love it"
well if moving here is gonna make them happy
it s almost as if this wasn t built for quick getaway
"if you need an easy way to remember it , just think of a bag of crap"
can you please just be mike hannigan again ? only if you ll be phoebe buffay
"so what if he want to sleep with her ? i mean , she is single and he is cute"
so if you take this job you ll be moving to paris ? or facing a bitch of a commute
and it means a lot if you could try to get on board
"do you think if the ralph lauren people offered her her old job back , she would take it ? how is that gonna happen ? is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes ? i don t know"
"but what if it is better than ours ? should we at least look ? what do you think pheebs ? well , i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin robbins anyway hey , isn t joey s agent estelle leonard ? yeah"
"what if he reads it in the paper ? unless snoopy says it to charlie brown , i think we re okay"
"uh what can i do for you ? uhm , well i m here to see if you ll give rachel her job back"
then we ll see if she wants to come back
"does little ross like dinosaurs by any chance ? yeah , they re all he talks about , why ? how would he like to come with me to the museum of natural history after everyone else has left just the two of us , and he can touch anything he wants"
we re buying the house next door and we were wondering if we could just take a look around
"i m showing it to someone else right now but please , look around"
"and if we re gonna cheat , shouldn t it be with like a hot younger house , that does stuff that our house won t do ? ours is so much better ! this living room is smaller , the dining room looks like a cave ! what a hole ! so ? what do you think ? love it ! well , we already have one offer on it and i think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one"
"the only way that that is going to happen , is if the other couple are the hitlers"
what if we got both houses ? huh ? we can turn this house into a guest house
"just the crickets and oh my god ! okay , but if we don t get this house she s still gonna show up wherever we go ! i mean , at least if she s here , it eliminates the element of surprise"
what if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg replica
"alright , let s play one more time , okay ? and remember , if i win you do not move to paris"
she can eat you if she wants
"hey , you know you can take it if you want ! the lease is still in nana s name ! no no"
but if you want you can go help him and joey pack up the guest room
"hey , what do you think they re doing in there ? huh , if i had to guess i d say rachel s putting on the bubble wrap and phoebe s doing the punching"
"what is it ? well , it s cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it , so that if they perfect the cloning process while you re over there , you can use the dna to create your own pheebs ! i i m gonna throw this away , but thank you so much for the gesture ! chandler ? i was just in our bedroom and i found these on my pillow"
"well , if i gonna do this , i d better keep going"
"mon okay i ve gotta just say what it is i m gonna say none of the amazing things that happened to me in the last ten years , would ve happened if it wasn t for you"
maybe she won t talk to me if it looks like we re deep in conversation
"maybe monica used to use them with don t say richard ! well , if they are not monica s and not yours , then whose are they ? well , i think you re forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room"
"okay ! i mean don t i deserve anything ? i mean , a few tears , a cursory hug ? not from you ! ross , if you re this upset , you should go and talk to her"
it d be great if you guys could pitch in
"and remember , if i m harsh with you , it is only because you re doing it wrong"
"chandler , wait , wait , wait what ? if you get a second , find out where she got that cheeseburger"
"when i think about not seeing you everyday , it makes me not want to go okay , so if you think that i didn t say goodbye to you because you don t mean as much to me as everybody else , you re wrong"
monica s gonna freak if every box isn t labeled
"okay , what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible ? what if they re not ? what if it s adopted by a king ? yeah , because i hear the king is looking to adopt"
i don t care if it s two babies
"i don t care if it s three babies ! i don t care if the entire cast of eight is enough comes out of there ! we are taking them home , because they are our children ! it looks like we re about ready over here"
"ross , rachel doesn t know that you wanna get back together if she did , she might feel differently"
"i don t know if that changes your plans at all , but"
"i mean , sometimes uh , joe ? damn it ! look , even if i were gonna tell her , i don t have to do it now"
"if i had more time to work on it , it d be better , but"
"look , even if she shoots me down , at least i won t spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened"
"if we hit anything , the engine will explode , so you know , it s better if you re thrown from the car"

what does that matter if she also sees me as this collection of goons ? ! there she is now
"and if you ever decide you ve had enough space , i ll be waiting for you"

"every step is on these recipe cards , except for one enjoy yourself ! i ll just follow the steps on the card , if that s okay with you"
"wow , you re reading francis mallmann ? yeah , but his cooking is all about trusting your instincts , and i don t know if i have those"
"what if you could learn instincts from someone like francis mallmann ? oh , my god"
bean if it helped me be a better cook
even if you had to come anyway to be the guy
"what ? did you say something ? was i still going ? well , you re a fool if you don t savor your nebuchadnezzars"
i can t tell if it s done
"now , if you excuse me , i must slumber and dream of spatchcocking t rexes with my childhood friend , jean baptiste"
"if you went there , it s possible they followed your scent back here"
"i mean , if i hadn t cheated , the bears never would have come here"
what would it mean if you messed up ? that there was something wrong with the measurements or the recipe
"and what if you messed up without a recipe ? what if it was just you , cooking , making your own decisions ? it d mean that there was something wrong with me , that i was the failure"
"if you re gonna cut off my leg , you need to cook it"
"oh , god ! what if it doesn t ? ! have a good night !"
"cause if i get in , i m going to mexico by myself to celebrate"
"tell you what if you can tell me which hand the strawberry s in , you re ready"
"crying if he gets cranky , just rock him to sleep"
"sighs , stops crying anything else ? three important rules"
"cut my life into pieces this is my last resort suffocation , no breathing don t give a hoot if i cut my arm bleeding beep"
"you sure you don t want something else ? wait , actually , do you have that prehistoric fish , the whatchamacallit , the the coelacanth ? unfortunately , no"
"where could he have gone off to ? if you don t eat and get out of here soon , muten roshi sama and the others will grow impatient waitin for you"
"if you d just let me touch your boobs a little bit , i d you just don t appreciate my gags , the same as always ! you re just a lecherous jerk , the same as always ! by the way , bulma san , what s happening with yamucha san ? yamucha ? that idiot ? how should i know about that guy ? i m so mad at him , i didn t tell him that everyone was getting together here today ! let s have ourselves a blast without him being here ! you guys sure do fight a lot"
"dragon balls , huh ? are you going to gather the dragon balls together and wish for something else ? i ain t got anything special that i want to wish for"
"and here i thought that now that goku has a family , his power might have diminished you ve got incredible power , the same as ever , huh ? w what is that ! ? what s wrong ? s something s coming this way ! something s coming ? i wonder if it s yamucha"
"you are a proud saiyan , the mightiest warrior race in the universe ! the universe ? warriors ? saiyan ? and i am your older brother , raditz ! g goku s older brother ! ? b brothers ! ? you re kidding ! stop talking nonsense ! r right ! if goku is from outer space , then what is he doing on earth ! ? the answer is simple"
"i if that s the truth , then you guys are awful ! that s crazy ! you even make piccolo look lovable ! how can you send babies off on their own ! ? kakarrot , given several years , you should have had plenty of time to purge these nuisances all by yourself ! if only you had remembered your orders , that is"
"hey , why is it so lucky that there s a moon here ? don t play stupid ! it is when the moon is at its fullest that we saiyans are at our best , you know ! what are you talking about ? i don t understand what you mean at all ! what ? i it can t be where s your tail ? what happened to your tail ! ? it got cut off and disappeared long ago ! h how can this be ? you miserable fool ! it s no wonder you were able to get along with the beings on this planet ! enough ! it doesn t matter if i am some whatever you call it guy from another planet , or if you are my big brother ! kuririn is right ! anyone like that is a lowlife ! i am son goku , and i was raised here ! now get out of here right now ! right ! right ! like he said ! whatever his past may be , right now , son goku is a fine earthling , more so than anyone else ! goku has even saved the world ! get lost ! get lost ! even so , i cannot allow this to be"
"your battle power is still incomplete , but if you were to join up with the three of us , you could still manage"
"stay away ! open your eyes , kakarrot ! it will be fun ! is your saiyan blood not stirred ? i m scared ! don t be ridiculous ! i d die before lending my hand to you ! so that s how it is , huh ? for a while now , i ve been wondering , that boy behind you is your son , isn t he ? n no ! it s no use trying to fool me ! that tail is proof that he carries saiyan blood , isn t it ? so what if he is ! ? since you , his father , won t listen to reason , i guess i ll have to borrow your son for a little while"
"if you want him returned alive , you ll listen to what your brother tells you to do ! d dammit ! g goku went down with only one blow ! kakarrot , i m giving you only one day , so think about it"
"if possible , i don t want to have to kill him"
"if you do , we will let you join our group"
"and of course , if there are no bodies here , it will mean the death of your son"
"if you don t mind letting this one die , then there s no need to have those bodies ready"
"kakarrot , if you re the one who kills a hundred people for me , it s all the same in the end , isn t it ? father ! father ! you got that , kakarrot ? any way you try to struggle out of it , the only thing for you to do is to join your brother s pals"
"with your incomplete battle power , you can t possibly stand up to your older brother , after all ! father ! see you later ! i look forward to tomorrow ! gohan ! father ! gohan ! damn it all ! he made a mockery of me ! are you okay , son kun ? w we re sorry ! there was nothing we could do ! g goku ? kinto un ! ! wait ! that s crazy ! don t be rash ! you can t ! you ll be killed ! if you go now , do you think you could win ! ? damn ! what should i do ? think"
"his tail if i if i squeeze his tail hard enough , his strength should drop off"
"t that s right and if the three of us fight together , it just might work though i m not very confident about that bulma san , if we die , please bring us back to life with the dragon balls , okay ? leave it to me ! kuririn , that won t work"
"damn and i wanted to get married too speaking of the dragon balls , what if we did this ? get all seven together , and ask shen long to save the world ! oh , yeah ! do you think we could get them all together in a single day ? oh , yeah all right ! we launch a surprise attack of our own ! he wouldn t possibly think that we would attack him , so his guard should be down"
"b but we don t know where he is , right ? bulma , do you have your dragon radar with you ? that s right ! the ornament at the top of gohan kun s hat was a dragon ball , huh ? that s it , that s it ! look ! it s moving at tremendous speed ! it stopped ! thank goodness ! he s not out in space , he s on earth ! all right , let s go ! it s all or nothing ! just hang on , gohan ! r right ! maybe we can win this ! the possibility is slim , though if we re going to be killed either way , we ll feel better if we ve done all we can"
"if you go with those two , you won t be able to defeat him"
"however if you and i team up , then there is a slight possibility that we can defeat him"
"i m not sure whether i should be elated or not you know , i would have never thought that those two would team up ! there s certainly no stronger combo than them ! it s just possible that they might win ! b but i wonder , is it safe for us to trust piccolo ? it s worrisome , isn t it ? what are you talking about ! ? this is going to be an incredible spectacle ! bulma ! do you remember the location that reading was coming from on the radar ? we re going too ! i wonder if gohan chan is havin fun at muten roshi sama s place"
"don t tell me you ve made the ridiculous determination that if the two of you attack me , you can win ! that s enough of your tiresome drivel"
"little by little , i m going to increase the strength of my attacks ! t to think that the difference in our levels would be this great ! somehow , i have to grab his tail , and make his power drop ! it s hopeless ! no matter what strategy you may have come up with , there s no way you can beat me ! i know why don t i let you in on something good before you die ? the two other saiyans besides me who are still alive have an even higher battle power than i do ! what unprecedented terror ! even if raditz is defeated , there are still even more powerful warriors ? there is nothing that goku and piccolo can do !"
"d dammit ! you say the other two saiyans are even stronger ! ? w what s going on here ? it s too late for you now , even if you do realize how terrible we saiyans are ! you ve got us there"
"in there , huh ? gohan father ! save me , father ! hold on , gohan ! daddy s going to come rescue you right away ! don t be ridiculous ! there s no way you can save him ! not if you guys die first ! all right , let s do it ! that s all we can do ! behind me ! yikes ! where did you go ! ? i m right here"
"it looks like your deaths are finally drawing near , huh ! ? i i wonder if goku is doing okay"
"that s all the more reason to be concerned ! what if piccolo double crosses goku , and teams up with that raditz guy ? if those two are done in , then there s nothing left that we can do"
"what are you two whispering about ? whatever strategy you devise , it won t work ! it d be easier on you if you d just keel over right away"
"if this doesn t work , then there s no other way to defeat him"
"and instead , you might end up saving me with it , huh ? if i am able to defeat him with this , then your turn is next"
"if i had taken that head on , i would have been out ! that doesn t mean anything if i don t hit you ! to think that you would inflict injury upon me ! you re going to pay for this ! i m through playing around ! w we ve had it now ! i ll obliterate you in an instant ! rot in hell ! ! you got careless , didn t you ! ? i ve got your tail ! why , you when did you get behind me ! ? piccolo ! now ! do that thing one more time ! y you got it ! nicely done , goku ! keep a firm grip on that tail ! i m limited to only being able to use this technique one more time"
"i m a first rate warrior ! i have absolutely no hesitations about killing you , even if you are my brother ! shall i provide you with a sample ? father there you go , there you go ! suffer even more ! your death is near ! what s the matter ? aren t you going to come at me ? try doing that thing you did earlier ! h he ll just dodge it again like this ! father that gohan ! i told him that once he gets his tests back , he should show them to me"
"w why , you ! you still have this much power left ! ? piccolo ! hurry ! do that technique from earlier ! i ve been getting it ready , just in case ! but it s still going to take a little bit more time ! why didn t you grab his tail ! ? if he decided to , he could cut off his tail on his own ! y you knew about that ? piccolo ! hurry ! hurry it up , please ! damn ! thanks to the blow that kid landed on me my power has dropped ! l let me go , kakarrot ! you idiot ! you re going to get it too , clinging to me like this ! i m going to die together with you ! y you re what ! ? are you out of your mind ! ? this is the only way there is to defeat you ! son goku ! i m not going to hesitate here"
"if i can wipe you out as well , nothing could be better for me ! but then again , your friends will probably just bring you back to life with the dragon balls"
"l wonder if gohan is adjustin okay to them still , he ll be okay"
"how does that sound ? if that were so , we could enjoy fighting forever ! i get you"
"w what are you saying , goku ! ? d don t give up ! this isn t like you ! goku ! t this time it doesn t look so good for me d don t worry ! we ll bring you back to life right away ! i m counting on it goku goku ! ! goku ! ! everything else aside , kakarrot s son s battle power was unusually high , compared to saiyan children"
"if we were to produce those guys one after another , then once again , saiyan rule will no longer be a dream"
"nevertheless , if it is kami sama , then we can relax"
"y you can t seriously be saying that i m not sure if that s going to be agreeable , you know ? we ll first have to take it up with goku , as well as his mother , chichi we don t have the time to spare for that ! keep up that bickering , and i ll take him away , even if it means killing you to do so ! after a year has passed , i ll be coming to your house , together with this kid"
"i don t know i don t know about this he s going to die ! even if he s lucky , he s still going to become a delinquent ! goku and chichi san are going to be upset"
"if you please , great king yama sama , allow him to call on kaio sama"
"if you wish to go that badly , you may go to where kaio sama is"
okay ! however i can t be responsible for you if you fall from the serpentine road
"even if we were to petition shen long to dispose of them , he probably wouldn t be able to win out against the incredible power of the saiyans"
"even if son goku does get trained by kaio sama , just how much will he improve ? our one and only salvation is goku s son"
"if there s something i can do for you , please wait until the sound of the beep well , i never ! where have they gone off to ! ? and here i ve come all this way to see my grandson knowin goku sa and those others , they re teachin gohan how to do somethin dangerous , i m sure of it ! well , that s okay , ain t it ? children should be a li l bit naughty"
"nothin doin ! if they re up to that and his mind goes numb on him , then what are we goin to do ! ? don t be silly ! no , if he goes learnin the martial arts , before long , he ll get kicked in the chin or somethin , and he ll get himself thrown into the ocean ! and then , and then , a man eater will catch his scent , or perhaps , he ll drift ashore to some uninhabited island ! he ll get hungry , and as he s tryin to grab some bananas , he ll get bitten by a snake , and the poison will circulate to his brain , and then and then after his mind has gone numb , what will we do ! ? okay , we re here"
"what do i do from here ? earnestly press on as you travel along this serpent , if you please"
"come up out of the water ! who are you ? father ? father ! where are you ! ? save me ! father ! father ! father ! i m scared ! i m scared ! sheesh , you dirty brat ! don t give me any trouble ! stop your bawling ! if you don t get quiet , i m going to snap your neck ! ready ? listen close to what i have to say"
"if they do that , your future s not going to be worth crap , is it ? but i m scared stop your griping ! you want to get killed right now ! ? we don t have time ! we re going to begin right now ! take off your tunic immediately ! once father comes back to life , i want to be taught by father"
"if you can survive without incident for six months , i ll teach you how to fight"
"wait ! where is there any food ? what about baths ? what about a bed ? what about books , and notebooks , and pencils , and you think there s any of that arranged for you here , sonny boy ? oh , no ! that s horrible ! if you have to blame something , then blame your own fate"
"maybe he just wants to leave something of himself behind , even if it is to son goku s son"
i wonder if the shock will be too much like that
"from here on , if you are unable to survive , then that s all you re worth as a kid"
"you can start by gnawin on its head goku nobody would have been able to tell them , right ? wah ! it s too bright ! i can t get down ! and i m hungry ! if you re hungry , you can just climb down from there and find something to eat"
"don t tell me you didn t say anything ! no what s the use ? geez , you re so spineless ! t that s easy for you to say , but if any normal person saw chichi san s face , they d be unable to tell her ! oh ? so you re saying that i m no normal person ! ? t that s not what i meant well , i suppose it s no surprise"
"if we wrote her a letter explaining what happened , perhaps she would understand"
"you re too soft , pa ! in these coming times , it s those who can study that will win out ! chichi ! chichi ! i ain t fastened in ! i wonder if this is it hey there , it s finally finished ! how nice of you guys to be napping around at a time like this ! now then , you there , grandpa turtle , stand on up"
"if ya wanna know details , some old hag named uranai baba s supposed to be along pretty soon"
"if you can survive here without anything happening to you for six months , i , piccolo sama , will personally put you through some hellish training ! so much so that you ll come to believe you d be better off dying ! brace yourself ! i ll also turn you into an outstanding demon clansman ! the goal is to bring down the saiyans"
something sure is weird ! huh ? wha ? huh ? it s gone ! my tail ! i wonder if it got pulled off while i was asleep
"if you want to survive , jump down from there"
"you don t mean it ! why are you acting like such a baby ? if you stay here , you ll just be buried in sand"
"but mister , if you d just cooperate with me ! do not turn to me ! and don t turn on my switch again"
mother is it okay if i eat all of this ? i can still eat more and more ! mister ! wake up ! again ? i told you not to wake me
"oh , i am so hungry ! i wonder if i can eat these clouds"
"anyhow , there might be someone else who comes searching the area that helps us out , huh ? it s been eighty years now since i ve been buried in the sand"
"if you don t hurry , the ceiling is going to come down ! dammit , my energy is beginning to leak out i ve connected them ! damn it all ! mister ! power at full ! now , son gohan ! mister ! take care of yourself"
you can t rely on anyone else around here if you re going to survive
"that s pretty demanding play ball ! i don t care if it hurts you let him hit you ! get hit by the pitch and load the bases ! strike ! so that s it , huh ? if you want to get hit so badly ! d dead ball ! w why , you ! you hit me on purpose , didn t you ! ? don t give me that ! you were trying to get hit ! why you bastard ! you want to go at it ! ? you mustn t , yamucha sama ! if you go in there , people are going to get hurt ! it ll be okay ! i ll go easy on them , okay ? ha ha ! ha ha but still here , here ! here ! here ! you bastard ! here , here ! this one can handle himself ! kuririn ! nice to see you after so long"
"if you were to apologize , though , that would be another story"
"who , me ? it doesn t bother me that i m not together with everyone else ! i don t care who comes attacking , i can take them on myself well enough"
you don t have to come if you don t want to
"if i don t step on it , a year will have gone by just like that"
"shen long father , hang in there ! this is terrible ! in three minutes , this planet will undergo a giant explosion ! full power ! ! what ! ? l it can t be ! is something the matter ? father father s ki has disappeared ! what did you say ! ? how could father lose ? then son kun is ? did you see that ? my percent power ! ? how about that ! ? that s what you get ! there was no way someone like you could have beaten freeza ! there s nothing else we can do ! you realize that , don t you gohan kun ? if we don t escape from here right now gohan kun ! bulma san , take piccolo san and return to earth ahead of us"
"that means if i return to earth , then freeza will go to earth next ! you re not , by any chance h hold on ! wait ! gohan kun ! i am my father s son goku s son ! and now i i will take on freeza ! you can t ! there s no way you can win ! i m sure piccolo san would say the same thing"
"if i get caught in the blast , i ll lose even more power sharply"
"if i can detain freeza for two minutes , he ll be gone , together with the planet i have succeeded"
"you can t ! not like that ! change that wish for me ! goku , you heard that ? what is this ? don t make it everyone except freeza , change it to everyone except for freeza and me ! goku , i know how you feel , but for the time being , return to earth ! if you don t let me settle this here and now with freeza , i will resent you the rest of my life ! goku ! i m begging you , kaio sama"
if that s how badly you want this
i wonder if he s really serious about fighting freeza ! i wish you would just bring son kun back with you ! then we could take off right away
"i shall then leave these two here , and move everyone else to earth"
if that s how badly you want to mix it up
"i it can t be that s ridiculous ! not even son could survive the planet exploding , even having defeated freeza , right ! ? s son if we wanted to , he could have left freeza behind and returned to earth together with us"
what s this ! ? have you come back to life as well ! ? it would have been fine if you d stayed dead on us ! too bad
"you ll have to entertain me a little longer ! for goku to have remained behind kami sama there s no time , goku ! that s right ! there are dragonballs here on earth as well , aren t there ? if i call on shen long to have me made undyingly youthful , i can reign over the universe forever ! that won t be possible"
"if the fight continues like this , it ll be just what freeza wants"
"it s said that if the leaves burn completely up , the traveler will return safely"
"oh ? we re foretelling what goku san will do , right ? see ? they re burning ! i m sure they ll all burn up ! goku san is coming back , isn t he ? that s right ! this fortune is sure to come true ! telling fortunes is nonsense ! father is certain to come back ! you re right ! father will beat freeza , and certainly come back ! dammit ! how long must i be bothered with the likes of this saiyan ! ? how s that , you monkey scum ! ? is this all you ve got ? what ! ? i asked you if this is all you ve got ! enough impudence ! ! you monkey scum ! not to the likes of a saiyan ! dammit ! i ll repay you for this tenfold no , a hundredfold ! i m stopping"
not if you re pinning all your hopes on such a petty technique
"if you absolutely have to settle this with me , then regain your strength and brush up on your skills"
"if i were to have one days time , i am sure it would be enough"
is there anything else ? i am quite busy
"if not , you may stand aside"
"you filthy rat ! stop , nappa ! freeza sama , if you will excuse us you monkey scum"
if we could have bulma san tell him i suppose so
"and so , if you would"
"i am dead , but if you can say i m fine , then i m fine"
"even if they did return to life , they d die immediately , since planet namek isn t there"
you can be my underling if you like
"son goku survived the z warriors all resurrected w why is it father and kuririn san cannot come back to life ? it appears to be okay if , like chaozu kun , your body is regenerated by kami sama and you re at kaio sama s place"
"just do it , okay ? okay , dende kun ? y yeah with so many of you here , if you were found out by anyone , there would be a big fuss over you ! that s certainly true"
"come drink with everyone else ! as it turns out , the namekians would live at bulma s home until the dragonballs reactivated"
"compared to earth , that s one third ! isn t that nice ? let s make our request of super shen long san right away ! j just a moment ! gohan and the others aren t here yet hey , wait a second ! hey , gohan ! pardon us ! my juku school ran long ! are you going to juku again ? such hard work ! i want to have my gohan chan studyin a whole lot , and have him become a great scholar ! well , we were just about to begin ! okay , dende kun , if you would ? right ! so this is the home grown shen long ? wow , this is incredible ! indeed ! it suddenly got dark ! what s happening ! ? what s that ! ? it s a monster ! wait , wait ! it s coming out of dr"
"a alive ? w what s this ? d don t tell me how did he ! ? hooray ! if he s alive , i wonder why he hasn t come home"
"well , if that s the case , you can have shen long call him here ! l i guess so , huh ? okay , now , the second wish ! please return kuririn back to life ! go ! go ! go ! huh ? kuririn san ! so that s it ! i ve come back to life ! hooray ! i have returned his dismembered body to its original state as a special free service"
"return yamucha to life , if you would"
"terrible happenings in heaven ! ! garlic jr ! to become kami ! ? there s some ! yo ! kuririn san ! quite a hault here , gohan ! yeah ! until father comes back , it s up to me bring home dinner every day ! good for you ! even so , this is a lot of fun ! kuririn san , why don t you try it too ? nah , i , uh ! ! ! okay ? this river is full of fish ! let s do this together , kuririn san ! now , hold , on , gohan ! that s not why i m here ! oh , you ll get your clothes all wet , huh ? no , that isn t it ! ! ! kuririn san , what a great car ! you bought that ? well , yeah , it s not much ! why not ? we haven t done anything in a while ! i ll hang around with you a bit ! right , then ! kurin chan ! aren t you done with your errand yet ? sorry , sorry ! i m coming now ! kuririn san , who is that ? well , she s sort of , you know ! maron is tired of waiting ! sorry bout that ! who is that little boy ? this is son goku s son , gohan ! her name is maron chan ! son goku san ? didn t i just tell you about him ? son goku , the master martial artist ! i wonder if you have ! anyway , this little boy is sure cute ! little one , how old are you ? five years old ! you know what , gohan chan ? your big brother and big sister here are on their way to a date at the kame something or other house ! and so , we can t play with you for a little while ! sorry , okay ? maron chan ! what are you ! ! ! ? oh , kurin chan , don t tell me you re jealous of this little boy ? that s not it , but still ! ! ! well then , one for kurin chan , too ! anyways , gohan ! ! ! everyone s getting together at the kame house to visit , since it s been so long ! why don t you come too ? sure , i ll go ! but i have to check with mother ! ! ! oh , yeah ! your mom sure is fussy about these kinds of things ! well , if she does let you , come on by ! everyone will be waiting for you kay ! see you ! that other person must be kuririn san s ! ! ! girlfriend ! what do you know , kuririn san finally found a girlfriend ! father will be so surprised when he comes back ! as strong as you are now , are you still advancing your training ? kami ! what business do you have with me ? you haven t changed at all , piccolo ! the reason i have appeared here is because i m thinking of having you come sit on the throne of kami ! what s this ? my limbs are growing heavy ! you should be able to serve as the earth s kami ! both in strength and mind , you are the only one there is who can take my place ! i have no interest in the throne of kami ! why don t you take a look around you ? the demon clan has been becoming activelately ! it maybe just a bad omen , or something may already be happenning ! in anycase , you should get ready for them , don t you think ? piccolo ! ! ! someone there ! that will be enough ! you re garlic jr ! it s been some time , mister popo ! why are you here ? you are child of garlic , who competed against kami sama and kami s throne ! but you supposed be sealed in own created dead zone ! that s right ! if it hadn t been for son goku , not to mention his son , everything , including the eternal life i got from the dragonballs , would have gone according to my plan ! but i will come back to life as many times as it takes to realize my revenge against kami ! i will be the absolute ruler ! can t move ! this is one of the specialties of the demonic four monarchs ! be a good fellow and give up ! i give up ! then answer my question ! where is kami ? don t know ! mister popo really don t know ! lying to us will do you no good ! mister popo not lie ! worthless fool ! not even your great power will work within that light ! i doubt you ll be able to escape from there ! you get to live ! you won t object if i wait here until kami returns ! i ll at least let you live that long ! cheers ! what do you know ? there s more to kuririn than we thought ! look at this guy ! he ignores his training , and manages to find such a cute sweetheart ! sweetheart is a bit strong , i wouldn t say that just yet ! oh ? you mean we aren t sweethearts ? in that case , i could go for this guy as well ! is that so ? oh , ow , ow , ow , ow ! yamucha ! yamucha sama ! ! ! just kidding ! don t take it so seriously ! i mean , right ? nuh uh , i was serious ! oh , no ! hold on , this has gone far enough ! just how do you feel about kuririn ? huh ? how do i feel about kurin chan ? maron doesn t know ! now that i think about it , kuririn might be better at this than i thought ! i envy him ! we have to settle this matter now ! hey , kuririn ! i am your master ! what is the matter ? this is sort of out of the blue ! ! ! in other words , i m something of a father figure to you ! however , i do not remember giving you my permission for you to be seeing a young lady like this ! but sir ! didn t you just congratulate me ? that s right ! now you re sounding high handed ! where s the harm in it , master sama ? you didn t let me finish ! it so happens that where this young lady is concerned , there s ! ! say , turtle chan , could you stop calling me a young lady like that ? i have a name , it s maron chan ! oh , i see ! well then , maron chan , as far as you re concerned , there s one condition ! condition ? it couldn t be ! ! what is it , turtle chan ? maron chan , you have to let me pafu pafu your hooters , just a little bit ! ow , ow , ow , ow ! what are you thinking ! ? really ! that was a joke , guys ! a joke ! i said no , an i mean no ! no matter what ? no way ! the longer you re hangin around goku sa s friends , the faster you get stupid ! how can you say that ? didn t you make a promise to your ma ? you said you d make up the studying you d missed before ! but ! ! ! you ve already used up your playing time ! you ll study until evening ! that s a good boy ! study hard ! what s this ? who s there ? garlic jr ! ! what are you doing here ! ? i welcome you to my temple , kami ! i had heard that you fools in the demon clan were up to something , but i did not think it was because you had escaped from the dead zone ! i see your arrogant manner of speech hasn t changed any ! mister popo ! mister popo ! where are you ? perhaps this is what you are looking for ? even having successfully guarded this temple for many hundreds of years , this is how mister popo wind sup when matched up against me ! what does someone like you , who mistakes his own level of status , come to this temple for ? garlic jr ! ! i can t believe you still aspire to the throne of kami ! ? what do you mean , you can t believe it ? i will replace the likes of you , and rule over this domain ! you insolent fool ! you expect me to just surrender the throne of kami ! ? interesting ! you sound as if you re about to show me what you re capable of ! so let s see what it is to have the power of a kami ! ! what ? kami ! submit , and kneel down before me ! i ll let you be one of my servants , if you like ! don t be absurd ! i m going to keep you alive for now ! after all , i need to use the dragonballs again ! the dragonballs ? for the time being , i m going to make you experience all the pain and suffering i felt , until i revive my father garlic ! i m sorry , mother ! i m a bad boy ! hey , cut it out , haiya dragon ! you want to come with me to the kame house ? kuririn san , we ll be right there ! it s here ! this is it ! garlic jr ! sama , what is it ? this is what my father garlic had taken from him by the previous kami , aquamist ! the water of oppression ! inside this container is the aquamist fog , the essence of the evil in mankind s heart ! anyone who inhales this mist will find themself reborn as a demon clansman ! the world will be turned into a hellish , demonic place ! and there , reigning over it from the highest point will be garlic jr ! sama , yes ? that is correct ! having over taken the throne of kami , garlic jr ! proceeds with his ambitious plan ! however , no one is yet aware of the reality of what has happened !"
"if he spends too much time playin at muten roshi s place , his lechery will rub off on him ! oh , my gohan chan ! pretty soon we ll see everyone , right haiya dragon ? whats the matter , haiya dragon ? what are you doing , haiya dragon ? really , what are you up to ? you re a strange one"
he s repeating what happened before if only son goku were here
"sama ! we ve found him ! what ! ? it s the son of son goku ! we ve found you , kid ! bring that kid here ! if we just capture him , son goku is sure to show himself ! kuririn ! besure to catch us something good for supper ! were counting on you ! yamucha san , how about lending a hand out here ? you said not to worry about it , that you were going to do this yourself to show that cute girlfriend of yours ! hi , kurin chan ! i ll help you out there"
"i don t want him associatin with any of his strange delinquent friends , if you please"
"did you just call me by the name auntie ? oh , if that s the way it came across , then i apologize"
i can t move ! didn t we just say you were no match for us ? who s there ! ? piccolo san ! if it isn t piccolo san
"those two are going to be so surprised ! yamucha sama , after you and everyone else have kami sama make you stronger , those saiyans will be nothing to you ! that s for sure ! if you re coming , then bring it on , saiyans ! wake up , nappa ! wake up ! open your eyes , nappa ! have we arrived at earth already ? no , not yet"
"if they re cute , i ll make them my pets"
"if you win , i ll give you anything you like"
"hey , if it turns out to be another good for nothing planet , we ll just blow it away too"
"if you would go along , he said he would be willing to forget about the past"
"please stop ! look out ! piccolo san ! piccolo san , are you all right ? i can handle this by myself ! you guys go to the heavenly realm ! get the ultra holy water away from garlic ! but gohan , let s leave this to piccolo ! there s no time to spare ! if we don t hurry , they re going to have their way ! go ! right ! okay , then ! this is unfortunate for all of you , but i need for you to die"
"if it gets really dangerous , you re going to save me , kurin chan"
"if we kill him , then kami dies , and we won t be able to use the dragonballs"
besides being bitten by one of these guys puts you in the same condition as if you had inhaled the aquamist
"where did he go ? you mean there are more of them than just you ? filthy saiyan monkeys ! so then , you don t know ? if you see freeza on the other side , tell him this for me i m going to beat the same kakarrot that killed you"
"so , tell me , where is son goku ? where is he hiding himself ? why hasn t he shown himself ? father is neither running nor hiding ! he just doesn t know you bad guys are around ! he doesn t know ? how do you mean ? i m going to i m going to take care of you ! if you don t want to talk , that s fine too"
"you miserable brat ! you brat ! your power is not greater than mine ! what was that power just now ? father ! you won t get away with this ! i will not let you get away with this ! if you can shoot him , then go ahead ! if kami here dies , piccolo dies too"
"what s the matter , kid ? if you aren t going to start this , then i will ! gohan ! whoa , i told you that i was going to fight you ! what s wrong with you ? is this all the power you have ? come now , you re supposed to be son goku s son"
"if you need anything else , just tell me"
"kuririn san ! kuririn san ! this is from me having slacked off in my training lately i couldn t move around the way i wanted to kuririn san ! gohan , never mind about me you ve got to get your hands on that ultra holy water by tomorrow morning otherwise piccolo , your mom , and everyone else can t be returned to normal ! what is it ? what am i lacking to become a super saiyan ? why was kakarrot able to become one ? why ? that oversoft scum ! why ! ? this ki a super saiyan ki kakarrot ? it is ! i ve found you at last , kakarrot ! there ! on top of that rock"
"that s it ? whoa , the way ahead is a restricted area ! kuririn san ! kuririn san ! kuririn san , don t tell me you too didn t you know , kid ? lf bitten by a member of the demon clan , once their saliva , flows through your body , it s the same as if you had breathed in the aquamist you become a demon clansman ! give it up , kid"
"! your lust for power ends here ! i m going to send you back into that world of darkness once again ! well , bring it on ! even if you have managed to obtain the ultra holy water , there s no way thatyou ll beable to use it in time"
"what ? even if you unseal the ultra holy water here , how many hours do you suppose it would take for it to cover the whole world ? before it does , the sun will have risen , and they will no longer be able to counteract the aquamist ! no matter what you do , you re out of time ! your plan appears to have failed as well"
"what ? if use seven currents that cover whole world , spreading ultra holy water easy"
"if kami sama goes there , give up being kami sama"
"kakarrot ! where are you ! ? see you in hell ! kienzan ! don t toy with me ! now to finish you ! kuririn san ! take this ! kuririn san ! what s the matter ? are you finished already ? piccolo ! you and kami are of one heart and one body ! if kami dies , you die as well , yes ? so whether he has his spirit taken from him and dies in the shinsenkai first , or you lose your life to me first , either way there s no possibility of you surviving , is there ? unfortunately for you , i m not as weak as you are"
"now it s my turn to lead off ! piccolo ! piccolo san ! worthless idiot ! what do you expect to do in your conditon ? dammit ! brat ! now then p piccolo , if i had a little more power remaining , l may have been able to protect you"
"to think that it would come to me needing your protection ! how low l ve sunk ! t thanks a lot ! but l ll try to extend yours and kami sama s life , even if just by a little bit"
"even l can be of use , right ? why , you ! after everything else , you attack with this ? what are you ? l lt s no use ! you ll payl you re gonna pay for thatl you piece of crap ! l ll kill you an inch at a time ! lm going to kill you so very painfully ! k kuririn ! piccolo stop ! haven t you died yet ? l ll send you both to hell at the same time ! what do you think you re doing , you lech ! ? who re you callin a lech ! ? lady , it s your fault for tossin in yer sleep ! look , look ! what a pretty sunrise ! how lovely ! huh ? karin chan , what are you doing ? how much longer ? there s no time left ! there , there that s the spot now stop doing that ! lt s the kid , huh ? shoot him ! gohan ! but shoot him ! blast him into so many pieces there won t be anything left ! gohan ! do it ! hurry up ! kami sama ! popo , here"
"gohan s brief chance for victory ! ! blast the makyo world ! ! ! die ! the dead zone wil be your grave ! g gohan ! k kami is ! ! ! k kami sama ! damn ! if we don t beat him , then dispersing the ultra holy water won t matter ! piccolo ! kami sama ! w what is happening now ? don t know ! probably garlic jr"
"piccolo ! piccolo san ! so you ve chosen your own death ? stay alive just a little longer , kami ! p piccolo ! idiot ! what are you planning ? fine , then ! if you want to rush your death , that s up to you ! go to hell ! now , gohan ! blast it ! piccolo san ! blast it gohan ! now , while piccolo has his attention ! but ! there s no time , gohan ! kuririn san ! fall ! fall ! is this all you ve got ? w what ! ? you think you re clever ! ? annoying insects ! now ! gohan ! blast it ! what ! ? o oh hell , no ! wherever you may be , i m going to find you , kakarrot ! i ll teach you who the number one saiyan in the universe is ! ahem , have i done anything ! ! ! inappropriate ? of all the ! ! ! where s gohan chan gone off to ? what does he mean by leavin me in such a place ? you there ! you guys stop spendin all your timeridin those useless toys , and study some ! right ! piccolo san ! ! ! kuririn san ! ! ! piccolo san ! kuririn san ! kami sama ! mister popo ! thank goodness ! you ve survived ! yeah , somehow or other ! ! ! hey ! ! ! gohan ! ! ! move it , would you ? yo , everyone ! kuririn san ! kuririn san ! kuririn san , thank goodness ! boy , that was a real close one there ! it s thanks to you destroying the makyo world ! piccolo san ! piccolo san ! if that rotten garlic s body hadn t gotten smaller , we would have been drawn into the dead zone instead ! i see ! at the moment garlic jr"

"if you want to get into a good school , you will submit to me ! now then , we will begin with a test"
"just looking at him makes chills go down my back ! if you look closer , you ll see he s a good guy"
i wonder if he found son kun or not
"what ll we do if gohan starts doin it too ? chichi , less formality , more food ! okay , then ! i ll put all my skill in to makin you somethin ! father , tell me a story about how you fought with freeza ! what have you been doing up until now ? hm ? hm ? how did you get back ? ? hm ? tell me ? father , tell me ! let go of me , kid ! let go ! owww , let go , kid ! hey , kid ! let go ! let go of me ! let go of my hand now ! you nasty brute ! if you ve got that much power , you don t need to nap , you should be applying that power to your studies ! oh , it was a dream ? well , i guess i should have expected as much from the son of a man who so inhuman , someone who directs all his attention to his own physical strengths , isn t that right ? well , you lousy dropout ? what are you looking at me like that for !"
"goku sa s fault ! ? that s right ! it s his father s fault ! this has nothing to do with father ! you be quiet ! this is the second year now that you haven t heard from him , isn t it ? how incredibly thoughtless of him ! stop talking badly about father ! but , since this is my job , if you were ask me to teach a pig or for that matter , a monkey , i would teach them"
"you did what ! ? you ve got a change of clothes there , right ? you presume to make me , the prince of the warrior saiyan race , wear something like this ! ? well then , how about going naked ? man , what a vulgar woman ! why , you oh , my , it suits you better than i thought ! don t laugh ! if you value your lives , don t laugh ! until son kun gets back , how about staying here ? that s a brave front , but i bet you don t have any money , do you ? and if you stay here , you ll know right away when son kun comes back"
"how can this be ? kakarrot , you scum ! you didn t finish him off ! this ki , are you sure it s freeza ? you think i could be mistaken about this ? under what stupid reasoning ? what did you say ! ? vegeta ! this isn t stupid reasoning , it s yakiniku seasoning ! i have a feeling that even if the earth were gone , bulma would survive"
we could blow it away with one blast if we wanted
"if we did that , i wouldn t be satisfied"
"where does vegeta get his speed from ? it s all i can do just to keep up ! if freeza has survived , that means kakarrot went too easy on him , as i feared"
"after all , when i was on namek , i didn t get to see him once ! you came to see him ? surely you know how dangerous he is ! sure i know , which is why we came ! if freeza wanted to , he could boom , blow up the whole world , right ? it doesn t matter where we are"
namekian ? piccolo ! how long has he been there ? gohan ! everyone s down there ! piccolo san s there too ! everyone else has been able to sense it
"he s survived ! not only that there s definitely someone else there , besides freeza"
"and you guysfought against someone that strong ? you ve gotta be kidding ! even if we get closer , what can we possibly do ? he s an unbelievably powerful beast ! and there s two of them ! there s nothing we can possibly do ! so what are you going to do ? stay here and rot ? be my guest"
"are you saying there is someone stronger than our clan , famed as the strongest in the universe ? if such is the case , then i , cold , vow to squeeze the life right out of them ! what is this ? send a lifeboat ! bring freeza back quickly ! curse you , monkey ! we ll be going to earth next , papa"
"papa , if the two of us fight him together , we re sure to beat him"
ain t i gotten to kaio sama s place yet ? i wonder if goku has arrived at kaio sama s place and is getting his training yet
i wonder if he ll be able to defend earth against the saiyans
"how about , instead , you team up with me and we hold up banks or something ? we could make a real bundle ! if we did , then you could eat as much of this delicious stuff as you want ! after all , from now on , money is everything ! money talks in this world ! as long as we have money , we ll be happy ! aren t you eating ? ten san , let s eat up ! that s more like it ! there s no need for you to hold back ! go on , baldy , chow down ! r right"
"y know , tenshinhan , holding up banks is fun ! just by shooting off your gun , everybody gets the jitters ! yeah , let s do it ! if you teamed up with me , there s nothing we d have to fear ! we d be invincible ! chaozu , training ! he s really got himself a hard head"
"if you want me to take you part of the way , i can give you a ride oni ! get on back of here oni ! really ? yahoo ! ready , pops ! all right , here we go oni ! chaozu ! ten san , you did it ! no"
"kami sama is going to be training you , after all ! ten san ! it s something better than i could have hoped for ! we ll go immediately ! ten san , we can train ! what s more what is it , baldy ! ? hey , tenshinhan if you re trying to run away from me , i m not about to let you"
"i don t care if you re going to kami sama s place or anywhere else , i m going to come with you"
"l m going to have kami sama train me through and through ! son , let s make sure we meet again ! kaio sama , i m son goku oni ! yow ! kaio sama , you re training is as tough as i expected ee yow ! ! w where is this place ? i wonder if i ve arrived at kaio sama s place without even realizing it"
or else you guys will die here too
"what ! ? well , this is a surprise ! i admire your ability to hold a bluff for so long ! it can t be ! what s this ? what kind of ki is this ! ? what s going on ! ? this is just like it was on namek ! it s father ! what ? it s the same ki that my father had back then ! that means a super saiyan ? impossible ! there s another super saiyan , besides kakarrot ! ? now there s two of them , and i m not among them ! ? this is a super saiyan ? those eyes ! those are the eyes ! what are you so frightened of ? burn in hell ! it s started ! damn ! don t fly ! i told you , they ll have scouters with them ! if we re discovered , we re finished ! if we want to get closer , we ll have to walk ! kuririn san ! gohan , where is goku and what is he doing ? much as i hate to say it , there s not a thing we can do ! once goku finally returns , earth may not even be here , dammit ! vegeta , surely you can manage something ? shut up ! unless you want to get killed with the rest of us , go home now ! you managed to return safely from namek"
"we ve come so far , how can we leave now ? who do you think you re talking to ? i ve been in scenes this dangerous many times before and i ve managed to come through them every single time i m bulma sama ! so then , let s go ! hey , vegeta ! take me with you ! you re on foot anyhow ! freeza , we won t be served if you destroy the planet"
"i wonder if he s really planning on greeting son goku , like he says"
"if you like , be my guest"
"why have you been staring at me so for the last while ? if you really are a saiyan yourself , i shouldn t be such a rare sight"
"well , like he said , if son goku really does show up here , we should be able to unravel some of this mystery"
i wonder if goku really is coming
"on top of that , i only meant to meet with you , son san , but instead i ve run into everyone else as well"
"if you re wondering how it is i can have saiyan blood , the reason is because i am the son of vegeta san overthere"
"well , like he said , if son goku really does show up here , we should be able to unravel some of this mystery"
"hold on , if there s two of them don t you have any allies ? no"
"now , please be sure to especially keep this matter a secret , okay ? if you say anything , and the feelings between the two of them go bad , then my very existence will be erased ! yeah , i got it , i got it ! well then , i will excuse myself now"
"it ll be nice if we can change the future , huh ? yes"
"if i m still alive after that time has passed , i will definitely come to help out ! three years from now"
"if it s too hard for you totell them , i ll do it for you"
"thank goodness ! boy , it s a good thing piccolo overheard you ! let me say now , that if any of you are unsure of yourselves , stay away"
we won t be any match for them if we have one of our own slowing us down
"what if we get rid of this doctor gero , the one who creates the artificial humans , right now ? even if we don t know where he is , we could use the dragonballs and ask shen long"
"if we do that , then we won t have to bother going through all that agony in three years"
"if we do so , we sure won t have to fight later ! great ! way to go , bulma san ! if you pull an uncalled for stunt like that , i ll kill you ! you got that ! ? what do you mean uncalled for ? this isn t a game you know ! the fate of the earth is in the balance ! bulma san ! bulma san ! son kun , you agree with me , don t you ? sorry"
"besides that , this scientist hasn t even built anything yet , how can we take him out ? the rest of you ! we don t have to go along with these saiyans ! they re just a race of fighting maniacs ! if you die this time , there s no bringing you back to life ! i m going to fight too"
"if i die , then i ll concede that that s all i could do"
we won t mind if you don t feel you re up to it
"no way ! no way ! nothin you say will change my mind ! then , you think gohan s studying is more important than the future of the world ? that s right ! of course it is ! it doesn t matter whatever else may happen ! gohan chan s studyin is more important than anythin ! you re such a kidder ! sorry , chichi ! i ve gotten too strong , and meant to just tap you ! i really am sorry"
"w what ! ? h hold on , chichi , this is so sudden ! no more discussin it ! startin tomorrow , you two are takin a break from trainin , and you re gonna start goin to the institute ! if you don t , neither of you get anythin to eat ! you got that ! ? so this is the institute that chichi was talking about ? i don t see why you had to bring me into this"
"but i ain t got that much time ! see , if i don t train , then the artificial humans will idiot"
"if you start driving recklessly like you were earlier , we will immediately expel you"
"terrible foreboding ? piccolo , do me a favor , if things get rough on you , don t overdo it"
"after all , if you die , the dragonballs will disappear too"
"if we can t lure the artificial humans away from here , the people down there will likely become casualties of our fight"
"you even guessed his name ! wow , really ? lncredible ! i wonder if i have psychic abilities"
"if they re really all that strong , we should be able to sense them anywhere on earth"
"if we can t sense their ki , we ll just have to search them out visually"
wait ! there ll be too many casualties here ! let s relocate to someplace where nobody s around ! you guys okay with that ? someplace where no one else is ? very well
how awful ! mommy ! why you i thought i would make us a place where no one else was around
"if that s right , then dr"
"if it becomes necessary , they figure they can fight us while hiding among the rocks"
"the way you say that , it almost sounds as if you were dr"
"hi ! is kurin chan there ? kurin chan , it s me ! oh , if it isn t maron chan ! say , where s kurin chan ? there s nothing like the real thing oh , yeah ! hows about a pafupafu or a tsuntsun ? maron finally realized something"
"red ribbon ? oh , i get it ! kurin chan is going to give me the red ribbon as a present , isn t he ? and if things were to continue that way , the earth s future would be all messed up , see ? that s what the boy who came back from the future world in the time capsule told us"
he s acting as if he s already near his full power
"okay now , okay now uh oh , i didn t bring anything else to wrap you up in"
"if only there was something else we could use good , everything s okay now"
"hurry up and get in ! blast off ! hey , gohan , don t you think it might be better if we pulled out ? what ? no , seriously"
"some of the circumstances may have changed , but isn t everything still just as he warned us ? but if we run now these guys will destroy the whole earth , just like they did that city earlier , i m sure of it ! i m saying , just until goku recovers from his illness there s no reason to still think that we will all be wiped out , like he said"
"history has changed ? that doesn t make these guys any less fearsome , does it ? no if you please , allow me to finish off vegeta"
"what ! ? him too ? vegeta san also turned into a super saiyan ! how can that be ? how could he be a super saiyan ? i thought if you didn t have a calm , still heart , you couldn t become a super saiyan"
"if there was an airplane capsule or something in here , i was going to borrow it"
"if i do not have it , it s not in there"
"if you can beat me in a contest , i ll give you a chance to get back to the serpentine road oni ! it s the jump device we keep just in case oni"
"if we lie , then we get our tongues pulled out by great king yama sama oni"
"i ll do it ! i m going to do it ! in exchange , if you lose , you forfeit your soul oni"
"if you go outside of this line , you lose oni"
"what ? have you tricked me ! ? hey , you ! so , in a nutshell , you just want to return to the serpentine road , is that right oni ? if so , there s a very good way to do so oni"
really ? tell me ! there s a secret path that nobody else knows about oni
"if you are good enough to be able to catch me , i ll tell you where the secret path is oni"
"if you lose i know ! come on , let s hurry and do this"
"if you weren t , then this wouldn t be any fun oni ! i was so close ! and he even dropped his guard , too ! that s awesome ! all right , then ! no matter how tough he may be , he can t come all the way up here oni"
"w what oni ! ? hold it ! hold it ! this is fun oni ! how about you live here with us oni ? if you do that , we can play tag every day oni ! you re right ! but i can t let that happen ! what s the matter oni ? you ll never get to where kaio sama is like this oni ! damn , i was so close , too"
he s something else oni
"no way oni ! if you eat one of those precious fruits , they say that you will avoid hunger for a hundred days , and your power will be bolstered oni"
"hey , you ! hold it ! if one of those gets eaten , i ll get chewed out by great king yama sama oni ! come on ! come on , come on ! hold it oni ! come on ! come on ! before you know it , the game of chase got switched around oni"
"l let s do it again oni ? are you thinking of breaking your promise ? great king yama will yank your tongue out ! it s over there oni ! if you climb the stairs inside here , you ll return to the serpentine road oni"
i wonder if that s because of that fruit
everyone else will take care of those guys
"if you re going to beat me , now is your chance"
if he had fought with that no
"regardless , i m going after them ! even if it s just to confirm with my own eyes that the artificial humans are finished"
"me too ! i m going too ! if we stop now , then i won t understand why i went through all that training ! all right then"
"if you find him , let vegeta or myself know immediately"
"i wanted to avoid the laboratory , if at all possible is he here too ? there s plenty of targets creeping around that i can steal energy from"
"if left unchecked , something terrible is bound to happen"
"really , where did he disappear to , anyhow ? if this is the way it s going to be , i wish i d done like vegeta said and went home to have some milk ! so then , whose energy should i take first ? it has to be piccolo , the most powerful one next to vegeta ! with what i can get from piccolo , anything becomes possible ! you just wait until i come for you , vegeta ! damn"
"no one will find us ! i know exactly where everyone else is ! now then , to take your energy g gohan , come here ! now ! t the artificial human s got me piccolo san ! which way ? a faint ki disruption"
"piccolo san ! let me handle this , vegeta ! stay out of this , no matter what ! if you re wanting to die , that s up to you but won t you just be providing him with more energy unnecessarily ? stay out of this ? this is perfect ! i ll just absorb his energy once again ! and once i do vegeta won t pose any that shouldn t have happened ! i must have let my guard down , that s all"
we ve won ! looks like what that young man from the future said was wrong ! what kind of artificial human is this ? what is everyone else fighting against ? this isn t right
"give chance ! ! ! thee search for doctor gero s mysterious laboratory what s that ? you say he s different ? what ! ? i it can t be ! who s been carvin up the earth down there ? look over there , over there ! that s where everyone is ! that s them , right ? that s son kun and the others ! s stop , you idiot ! you seriously wanna go there ? it s all right , i tell you ! if everyone s still alive , that surely means it s all over ! you take us any closer , an i ll drop this rugrat right outta here ! oh ? be my guest"
that s fine if it s true
"now then , what should i do ? how can i get back to the laboratory ? if i try to fly away , i ll likely be overtaken"
"that is strange , huh ? i wonder if he s converted himself ? there , there ! ain t no one gonna pay me no attention ? hey ! that artificial human just now was probably doctor gero ! doctor gero ! ? that was doctor gero ! ? what s that supposed to mean ? like i said , i ve seen his picture before"
"is that how badly time has been shifted ? goku sa ! hang in there ! you don t suppose we might be too late with the medicine , do you ? you ve got to hold on , goku ! goku sa ! you just wait , vegeta and piccolo ! you re about to get a taste of just how terrible we artificial humans really are ! what do you think you re doing , vegeta ! ? if you come any closer with that scary face of yours , you re going to make trunks cry again ! there , there now i know it s surprising how scary his face is isn t it ? bulma , do you know where doctor gero s laboratory is located ? he s heading back that way for sure ! the location ? well , as i recall , it was somewhere in the mountains surrounding metro north"
even if we were to take off after him we re all right
"if we re too late to do that , we should avoid battle until son goku san has recovered from his illness"
"and tell him if he gets well in time , we d like him to join us"
the rest of us have what it takes if were just destroying the artificial humans
"say , gohan kun , yon can speed up a little if you want"
", or anything else , i ll turn them to scrap quickly ! it s already too late ! you will all be killed ! t this is my first time against anyone like this against anyone this strange ! goku sa ! goku sa ! goku sa ! goku sa ! goku ! hang on , goku ! goku sa , are you all right ? get a hold of yourself , goku sa ! he must be havin a pretty terrifyin dream"
"i see it ! what about vegeta ? if we don t find the laboratory before vegeta does , things are going to get really bad"
"you want to fight with the artificial humans , don t you ? what do you think you re going to do once we get to the laboratory ? are you planning on destroying the artificial humans , even if you have to fight me to do so ? that s probably what it will come to"
"and that s just what we ll relay to your father , trunks ! please stop kiddin round , bulma sama ! if trunks san hadn t warned us ahead of time , we wouldnt have known about father s illness or about the artificial humans , or any of this"
"if we don t act fast , no"
"everyone , come quick ! he found it ? what s with this ki ? if there were another way , i wouldn t think of activating these two"
"you should have said so sooner ! what can we do if we re too late ! ? they re here ! those fearless , contemptible fools ! so , you guys are on"
"how come with the newer model , you went back to the old energy absorption style ? i wonder if it s because the eternal energy models had too much power , and were out of your control"
if only i had my controller no
i wonder what else is different
"except for myself , i doubt anyone else can handle them"
"at any rate , do not activate it ! if you do , it could cost all of us our heads ! it could cost all of us our heads ? even though according to this data , my power is higher ? t that s right ! i don t care"
"no you don t ! i won t iet you add any more artificial humans ! you crazy idiot ! if you re going to do that , say something before hand , all right ? stupid jackass ! your actions are worthless ! what do you mean , worthless ? take a look overthere"
he said it might cost all of us our heads if we did
"if we don t include goku san s power and all fight together , we absolutely cannot win ! you re laboring under the wrong impression"
"yajirobe , do you have anything else i can use to bundle him up ? you think i d give you anythin else ? but trunks chan might catch cold ! just relax ! we all know trunks ll grow up as big s he is with no trouble"
"oh , i guess you re right trunks chan , it ll take more than this to chill you , huh ? great , great ! ooh , great ! ooh , great , great ! bulma san if it s okay , i d like to hurry up a bit"
i wonder if father is doing better yet
"if doctor gero had the technical skills to build an artificial human from nothing , why did he go back in the direction of building them from a human base ? yo ! i didn t expect to find you dallying around here like this"
there s no way i can tell if you wind up mannequins suffer damage or not
"hey , you numbskulls ! what do you think you re doing in the middle of the road ? blithering halfwits ! if you don t get out of the way , i ll run right over on top of you ! just keep smiling , while you re still able to"
"if i gave it my all , it would destroy the earth"
"if you get killed , your pride won t be worth crap"
"p please ! you want another beating ? you re in our way ! get lost , now ! if you want to run , you re free to do so"
"s one on one fight , but if you do , i will have to join in as well"
"yo , honey ! come aboard with us ! honey , let s go get something to drink ! yeah ? sure , but then we ll get some cake , something sweet to eat , right ? how s that sound ? huh ? what s your problem ? puny turtle , you re going to get hurt if you try to mess with us human beings"
"tell them that if they manage to toughen up any , we re willing to take them on again"
"besides , if we smash things around enough , he ll come to us"
"what ? you mean they even knew the word senzu ! ? what does it mean ? if they knew so much , why didn t they kill us ? good question"
"if you had joined in , there s not a thing you could have done"
"dammit , if only goku were healthy ! this guy easily took care of even freeza"
"he said if kami sama and piccolo hadn t split up , they could have stood up to even a saiyan"
"what ? if kami sama and mao join bodies , they ll return to a namekian warrior"
"however , since piccolo is so much more powerful now , they ll become an exceptional warrior ! if goku and company are super saiyans , then piccolo would be a super namekian ! super namekian ? that s incredible ! but if so , and kami sama disappears , won t the dragonballs also vanish ? yeah , probably so"
"but if piccolo or kami sama were to get killed , the dragonballs would vanish anyhow"
"if piccolo really is planning on reuniting with kami sama if he really feels that boxed in by the three artifcial humans , it should tell us how fierce an enemy they are"
"maron chan ! huh ? has kuririn come back ? maron , i ve been looking for you ! well , if it isn t mark ! hey , maron ! ah , tommy ! maron ! i love you ! i came flying back for you ! oh , you ve all come for me ? maron s so touched ! w what s all this commotion ? just a minute , guys ! oh , maron chan , what is all this ? things got dull , so i called my boyfriends"
"y you mean these guys are all your boyfriends , maron chan ? that s right ! each of them has proposed to maron , but they re all so handsome , i can t decide ! everyone else is waiting , so i m leaving ! give kurin chan my regards ! see ya ! she really left"
"still , even if it were just once i wanted to pafu pafu with maron chan s chest ! what a pity ! say , trunks , how long will it take goku to get better with that medicine you gave him ? knowing goku san , i d say he ll be fine in ten days or so"
"but if this is to be the iast judgment i make as myseif , then i wouid iike a conciusive reason to proceed"
"you are ? if the situation gets bad once again , i ii be back"
"you know what , officer ? if you want to see someone resisting hey , hoid it ! what are you doing ? doing something iike this is caiied resisting"
"why do you ask ? oh , yeah , weii , i was just thinking , it d be great for us , you know , if they weren t"
"however , even then , the sound of a new mystery was about to make itseif known to buima"
"what a waste ! what s the matter , mother ? well , get to it ! at a time like this ? no matter what time it is , studyin is important ! you really are something else , chichi san"
"so what do we do now ? not that i would know what should we do ? h how does this sound ? what if i took the time machine back further into the past , and destroy them before they re activated ? l know the location of doctor gero s laboratory and all i get you"
"i thought your time machine didn t quite work perfectly , did it ? and from what goku said , it takes an awfully long time to store enough energy to make a round trip , right ? if you go further into the past , are you sure you can return to your future ? not exactly you know , i was thinking , if trunks san goes back a little further in time , and even if you re able to destroy the artificial humans there , what will happen to the artificial humans that are here now ? will they suddenly disappear ? gohan , you should just be studyin like a good boy"
"t that s right ! i d forgotten ! undoubtedly , if i were to go back to the past and destroy the artificial humans , the future of that world of that time would be saved"
"mom mom was so ticked off by us always being clobbered by the artificial humans , she thought it would be nice if there was a peaceful future where they had been beaten"
"however , they couldn t figure out for the world how to start it up , and they were asking if we could tell them"
"we asked them if they were sure it was one of our products , and they said , it says right here on the body , capsule corporation"
what s that ? i wonder if this is kaio sama s residence
"i won t have him get away from us ! snake princess sama , if i mix this sleeping potion in with the cooking , it will bring on an irresistible urge to sleep , he ll doze off , and won t leave here ! well , it s not a very elegant method , but what choice do we have ? sorry to keep you waiting"
"all right , i m eating ! i if you like , help yourself to my serving as well"
how about if you took a bath before going ? kaio sama dislikes dirty people
"he s not single ! ? he still looks delicious , though ! are you going to eat this one too ? i wonder if there will be any for us this time"
"why , you ! i am the serpentine road goddess , who has lived on the serpentine road for a thousand and five hundred years ! how dare you bring disgrace upon me ! now listen to me ! you will never return home from here ! what is this ? if you cannot realize my charms , then you can just dissolve away ! this is bad ! i ve got to get out of here quick ! dammit that was close ! why , you ! you re not getting away ! damn ! in that case ka me no , i won t"
"hey , let me pass ! i have to hurry and go see kaio sama ! no way ! if you want to live , you ll have to defeat me ! damn i know ! wait up ! see you ! thanks for the meal ! and the bath , too ! this is so degrading ! the journey to kaio sama is still far"
how can this possibly be ? does she know the exact location of where this photo was taken ? he asks if you know exactly where this time machine is
"is it okay if i come ? gohan chan ! it s all right , mother"
"if he hadn t , do you think he would have reactivated them ? of course , that must be it ! there s a slim possibility section west should be under us now"
"eggshell ? if that s an egg , i ve never seen another egg like it"
"all of that happened , huh ? it d be great if goku were able to get better before they come looking here"
"just a minute ! if the artificial humans are after goku , won t this house be the very next place they come looking ! ? yeah , probably so"
"you guys will be at the kame house , right ? if anything happens , i ll be in touch"
"trunks , if you get the time , come visit ! grandma and grandpa will love it ! what exactly is happening now ? i don t know ! i absolutely do not know ! still peeping down on the lower realm ? can t say i approve of your little pastime"
it appears as if the people inside them simply melted away
"m maybe so , but i i m going too ! you can t go ! goku sa is still sleepin up there ! why can t you behave a little better ! ? mother , it s exactly because father is sick that i no way ! even if the whole universe is blowin up , you ll stay at my side ! you mean ? i ll go by myself"
"gohan san , if anything happens , you and the others have to be here , to protect goku san from the artificial humans"
"if it gets dangerous , come back here quick , okay ? yeah , he s right"
someone else has appeared
i wonder if a volcano just exploded somewhere
"it would be nice if there were no further casualties this information just in please watch , as we have images of one of the tank divisions as they head toward the scene"
"that s rather convenient ! then it s no wonder you re so strong , even though you still look as if you were piccolo daimao"
"i m not letting you get away ! you can t escape by using the sort of kamehame ha you did before ! kamehame ha ! ? how can this guy use goku s kamehame ha ! ? not just the kamehame ha , kuririn ! if i wanted to , i could probably even form a genki dama ! i m stunned ! he even knows my name ! how ! ? when i tell goku , i m sure he ll be surprised too ! oh ? son goku is still alive , is he ? of course he is ! so , he s still alive it appears things are turning out slightly different from the history i know"
"hey ! don t just stand there like a moron , get out of the way ! once incapacitated , even if we are talking about no"
"and if piccolo and company discover me , i ll just move on to another place ! damn you ! battle formation ! w what ! ? vegeta ! ? then he hasn t been killed by no"
"what ! ? say , just so you know , i don t like these clothes , okay ? if we come across a good city somewhere , you ve got to take us there ! i know , already"
"but can we seek him out ? now that he knows of piccolo san s unexpectedly great strength , won t he just assault other people while keeping his ki suppressed ? if we don t prevent cell , no"
"it will be terrible for all the worlds in the universe ! don t forget that he has freeza and his father s blood running through him as well ! my blood too ! you ve got nothing but clumsy strategies ! if he wants to merge with them , then let him ! it ll reduce the number of opponents we have to beat and save us some trouble"
"i don t care what becomes of my enemy ! i ll just kill them anyhow ! don t take it so lightly , vegeta ! if they merge , then as utterly unmanageable as no"
"well , if it doesn t look like you re going to find cell , come to the kame house"
"? his , huh ? i if i have mom look at these , she just might be able to catch on to a weakness in no"
"if he really can go beyond being a super saiyan , then i that s fine , but well , he s your father , so i don t want to say anything bad , but i don t think vegeta will let you do anything with him"
"and if we hold our ki , we can t go very fast ! useless , useless ! while they re prowling around down there , i think i ll go get my next meal ! so you re saying you want us to find a weakness in no"
"if only doctor gero had applied his genius a better way , the world could be at peace"
"right ! if you would be so kind ! are we there yet , no"
"at the time , i thought that if only goku san hadn t died of his illness , and instead lived , he could save us from a future wrought with devastation by the artificial humans"
"if dad can overcome super saiyan , why not me ? mom dammit ! has he gotten away again ! ? if he s able to search out our ki and escape every which way from us this well , we have absolutely no way to strike at him ! if i keep taking life essences at this pace , then the time when i absorb no"
won t it be easier if i do this ? see ? i feel much better
"i know ! gohan ! be careful ! if we come up on him like this , cell won t be aware of our ki ! this time , we ve got him for sure ! let s defeat him before he combines with no"
"even if we do get close , if he hides on us , there ll be no way to find him"
"if vegeta can t win against them now , i can t win either"
"however , if i ain t as much as that , i can t possibly win against this opponent"
"i ll train for a year , and if it s no use , i ll give it up"
one year ? if it takes that long it s okay
"there s no helpin it , so if you re goin to do it at all , make him good and strong ! chichi however , once this fightin with the artificial humans is over , i won t let you get in the way of gohan chan s studyin , no matter what"
"if we don t do this quick , he ll run away on us again ! if we don t do this quick , he ll run away on us"
if only goku were here
"goku ! yeah , if goku were here goku ! you see , with goku s instantaneous movement father ! whoosh ! we d be oh ? yo ! right , just like that , he could appear anywhere huh ? go go go yo , kuririn ! goku ! ! goku ! i ve missed you ! man , have i been waiting for this ! when did you wake up ? you re all better then ? yeah"
if he combines with no
"if you don t tell us , we intend to force it out of you"
"are you buying time ? or is it that you re just a fool ! ? so , if you re going to bring it , bring it ! will you alone be the one fighting , no"
"yes ! if i have only one opponent , something just might come of this ! if i can defeat either no"
", i can prevent cell from becoming his perfect form ! here we are so far away , and yet it s as if he s raising his ki right before our eyes ! a awesome ! to think it was this high ! no"
"even if i can create all the code it takes for the shutdown , i still have to input it on all the frequencies for each circuit"
"aren t you , trunks ? is it okay now ? are you finished ? with this , we ll be able to utterly terminate artificial humans actions ! my , my ! what do we do , kuririn ? h how can i answer something like that ? if this cell monster were to absorb the artificial humans now , all of our hopes would vanish"
"have emergency shutdown circuitry incorporated into their bodies ! once we shut off activity in those circuits , then no matter if they are artificial humans , you can destroy them easily , right ? yeah ! i just completed a controller that will do it ! say , can we beat the artificial humans ? uh huh beg your pardon , but could you bring it here right away ? right now , piccolo san is fighting with them the artificial humans ! sure ! i ll leave right away ! great ! if we destroy no"
"take good care , if you please"
"what s this if you please ! ? you were gonna leave here all by yerself , weren cha ? the earth is in great danger ! let me go ! f father ! cell has cell has started to move ! yeah"
"if i had taken that head on , i would have been out ! that doesn t mean anything if i don t hit you ! to think that you would inflict injury upon me ! you re going to pay for this ! i m through playing around ! it doesn t mean anything if i don t hit you ! all right ! wow , i did it ! i lost a great deal of time to old lady snake there"
"if i don t hurry up , things will get nasty ! oh , no you don t ! hey , we meet again ! it sure is big ! i wonder how long this beach goes on for"
"i ll get through i ll get through the storm soon enough ! ah , this is bad ! if this keeps up , i ll be swamped ! and i can t swim ! i can t swim ! i can t swim ! that dirty brat ! where the hell did he go ? gohan , what about your training with piccolo ? have you forgotten about the crisis the world is in ? eight months remain until the saiyans arrive"
"what are you going to do about it , piccolo ? if you wish to interfere , come right ahead"
"i m going to go fly there and pick it up ! if i fly all out , i m a lot faster than bulma san s plane ! kuririn i m going to go help piccolo ! even if i can t do anything for him , it s better than just waiting here ! s stop ! tenshinhan , get back here ! do you want to throw your life away ! ? damn , there s not a thing i can do now"
if no
"then we weren t in time ? kami sama ! gohan ! wait , gohan ! piccolo sama ! ! piccolo sama ! ! gohan ! if you go now , you can t beat him ! wait ! in any case , all we can do is wait ! still not yet , vegeta ? what are you doing ! ? piccolo at length has fallen before the terrifying artificial human cell"
"popo san if go now , cannot defeat cell"
"even so even so , it s better than just waiting around here iooking on as everyone else gets killed ! you saiyans only hope left in world to defeat cell"
"if waste this important life , kami sama no , piccolo angry ! look ! vegeta , get out here , quick ! even having merged with kami , he was still no match for me , all powered up ! sorry to keep you waiting"
"i will be taking you very shortly ! if you re coming at me , then come on ! useless resistance , you say ! ? i won t be had so easily ! you monstrous punk ! you expect me to let you absorb me ! ? this is bad ! the difference in their power is too great ! trunks ! you must not touch this ! this is something very important , after all ! oops , this isn t any good"
if we don t stop no
if you and no
"together , let us create the perfect form ! just try coming any closer ! i ll blow myself up if you do ! if i die on you , you re screwed , right ! ? do you hear my voice , no"
"! ! we hated doctor gero for reconstructing us as he pleased ! under no circumstances would he ever say doctor gero sama ! ! having come to this , i will absorb you , even if i have to force you ! cut out the useless resistance ! for you to launch an energy blast , you will need a moment to charge it"
"cut it out ! stop it already ! stop it , tenshinhan ! if you use the kikoho technique any more than this , you ll die ! cell has at last absorbed no"
"! d damned if i m letting you get away ! why , you r rotten monster ! t tenshinhan san is hanging in there"
"if keeps this up s stop it , tenshinhan ! don t use your kikoho any more ! i said stop it , and i mean stop it ! s still , the only one who can keep cell in check right now is me a as long as my energy holds out s such an enormous ki ! h how will this turn out ? c chaozu t ten san s g going to die s sorry , chaozu"
"he s just too strong ! what are you sayin ! ? goku sa s still around , isn t he ! ? gohan chan s gettin stronger ! on top of that , goku sa s about to go and take care of that monster ! it s no good ! tenshinhan s ki has dropped substantially ! if things keep going like this , tenshinhan will be ten san chaozu , let s go ! right ! h hold on ! even if you do go , there isn t anything any more that you can do ! not only that , but you will just add to our casualties ! but ! it s just as chichi said"
"they ve escaped , have they ? can t you move ! ? to think that i could possibly have been hindered by the likes of you ! h he ll be killed ! t tenshinhan san ! damn you look like you ll die even if i leave you be but i ll eradicate you anyway ! f father ! w what ! ? son goku ? so you re cell ? h how did he just appear ? it looks as though you re one fantastic monster"
"but even if you were to go in now and train , it won t do any good , because i m going to dispose of everything including cell and the artificial humans"
"so this is kami sama s temple , huh ? hey there , everyone ! where are you ? if you re here , come on out ! that s bulma san s voice ! they re here , they re here ! bulma , why are you here ? i asked kuririn"
"because you re going to defeat that monster cell , right ? if so , that will be best ! so then , why don t i go beat cell now ? shall i take you to him with my instantaneous movement ? don t be absurd"
"if it gets dicey , get out of there right away ! got it ? yes"
"! ! show yourself ! ! if you don t show yourself , i m going to destroy these islands one after another ! ! you got that ! ? you have to hear me ! no"
"! ! i am not bluffing ! ! you must be thinking that if i destroy you , then i will not be able to achieve my perfect form , so there s no way i would do so ! ! w what is this ? that s just too bad ! ! it is certainly true that i desire to become my perfect form , but even as i am now , there is already no one in the world that can oppose me ! ! come on out ! no"
"you ll know right away who the strongest in the universe is ! if you do not come out , i will destroy all these islands ! ! you got that ! ? you despicable piece of crap ! it s all right , no"
"even if he does spare me , with your injuries , you will not survive ! why is it that cell is as particular as this about becoming his perfect form ? he already has enough power to make himself invincible"
he s of a different dimension ! if cell were to absorb no
"anyhow , it appears i can t do anything else but examine the entire ocean in this area"
"one left he s coming ! calm down ! don t give up until the end ! if you are absorbed , it will be the end of everything ! well , you better come on out , no"
i m shocked to think that my cells were being used by a repulsive monster such as yourself ! i wonder if you were supposed to have turned out a little better
"if you like , shall i wait for even more to arrive ? he s just a spectator"
"be careful ! if you go too far away , you might not be able to find your way back here , get lost and die ! r right ! the temperature varies from degrees to minus degrees"
"but then , gohan , if you can so much as become super saiyan , you ll be much more help to me as a drill partner ! you are my son"
"naturally , i intend to obtain power beyond super saiyan ! i want to be stronger than anyone else , after all ! but gohan , i intend to have you even surpass me ! m me surpass you , father ? that s right"
"besides that , the you that died in the future never trained in here , right ? that s right ! it s all up to your own determination ! father , if you please ! all right , that s the spirit ! i m going to be far more hard on you than piccolo was , you know ! prepare yourself ! right ! d don t tell me it s still increasing ! what is that ! ? how can vegeta have that kind of power ? i don t believe it ! is training in the room of spirit and time as magnificent as all this ? say , what s wrong ? what s happened to vegeta ? trunks is okay , right ? w what is this ! ? without a doubt , he has surpassed super saiyan"
"good grief ! ah , well , freeza or anything else is okay ! right ! i it s no use starting right now , i m going to show you what hell is ! i shall enjoy it"
"if that s the case , then don t hold yourself back for me"
"if you ve got enough spare time to go on prattling like that , why not worry after your own well being instead ? however hopeless that might be"
"incredible ! there s no comparison ! come ! where are you hiding yourself ? dammit ! where are you ! ? it would appear as if you have received quite a shock , huh cell ? why don t i tell you of an even further shocking fact ? over there is a guy named trunks"
"how damned disappointing ! you pantywaist ! here i came , wondering what an exceptional guy you must be but now , somehow killing you has become such a frivolous matter ! damn it to hell ! ! damn it all to hell ! ! my perfect form if only i could become my perfect form ! that sort of guy wouldn t be so damn ! lousy no"
"right away ! if she s found by cell damn it all ! ! damn it all ! ! i incredible i if only i could become my perfect form ! if only i could become my perfect form , t the likes of that guy would be ! so , what ? you re saying that if you could become your perfect form , you wouldn t be losing to me ? that s right ! i absolutely would not lose ! power , speed , techniques , brains , mental strength in all things , i will achieve a perfect existence ! that s what the computer told me ! dammit ! if only i could become my perfect form ! damn it all ! ! incredible when he fought with me , could he have been purposely pretending to be weaker ? no , there isn t any reason why he would have had to do that"
"as well ! however , you have to draw to within meters , or it won t have any effect , okay ? within meters ! all right ! i if only i could absorb no"
"there they are ! somehow , i have to get closer within meters of them without them noticing if i m seen , it s all over"
"what am i thinking here , at an important time like this ! ? what a start ! don t scare me like that ! ah , you fool ! the artificial humans are there ! despite the obvious gap between us , you re saying that if you became your perfect form , you would beat me ? i i would unmistakably beat you ! if you re at that level , that is d dad , don t tell me ! h he can t mean to ! no"
", do not worry about me , run away at any time ! you seem to be considering it how about it , vegeta ? you saiyans are a warrior race through and through ! fighting is your passion ! however , the stronger your opponent , the greater the joy you take in fighting ! isn t that so ? am i wrong ? you d like to try fighting , wouldn t you against me , in my perfect form ? you must want to ! you are the prince of the warrior race , the saiyans , after all ! within meters within meters just a bit farther all right e even if i use this controller to stop no"
"was originally just a cute human girl if she hadn t been reconstructed by doctor gero i even feel sorry for her ! i wouldn t really have to destroy her no ! if she is absorbed by cell , and then cell becomes his perfect form , people all over the world might be killed ! destroy her don t destroy her destroy her don t destroy her destroy her don t destroy her destroy her destroy her destroy her destroy her the water s just right , huh gohan ? yes ! my fatigue feels like it s flying away ! so , i wonder how kuririn san and the others are doing right now"
go ! dad ! i would not be proud of myself if i defeated you the pathetic way you are now
"dad ! you can t ! if you let him do that that s you re greatest fault , dad ! shut up , trunks ! i m not above fixing it so that you ll never take that insolent tone with me again ! you should know better than anyone how incredible the power beyond super saiyan that i have is ! so , get going ! i m looking forward to this , cell"
"get away safely ! no matter what , don t get absorbed by cell ! please ! why ! ? why did you break the controller ! ? it must have been your chance , right ? to destroy me ? t that s kid , move it ! if you have the time to interfere with me , why not help out in searching for no"
"this is bad ! they haven t realized that they ve been found ! why ! ? this was your singular chance ! just what is it you think you re doing ? i it s just stop staring me down like that , would you ? that doesn t matter ! in any case , just get away safely ! if you re too slow about it , you ll be swallowed up by cell , you know ! i beg you ! the destiny of the earth rests with you ! hey ! ! you ve been found by cell ! oh , no ! i will not allow you your perfect form ! so , then luckily enough , the artificial humans are here , huh ? amazing ! is that how strong trunks has become ? his ki has vanished"
"you miserable monster ! dad , you are mistaken ! we can t let him reach his perfect form ! what are you going to do if his power becomes greater than ours ? you re so pathetic ! don t you feel like seeing how strong he will become ? i i don t want to see it ! i ve had enough hellish futures ! you ll see , i will prevent his perfect form ! even if i have to defeat you , dad ! defeat me ? impossible ! i don t think you re capable of attacking your father"
"if you can shoot me , then shoot me ! i i m sorry , father"
"don t you disappoint me this time ! damned if i m going to let you reach your perfect form ! what s going on here ? it s as if the whole earth is trembling , you know ? cell s ki is continuing to swell up ! grand elder sama ! dende , huh ? you ve felt it too , have you ? what is this evil ki ? what in the world is happening on earth ? i don t know"
"really ? you can tell if he s dead or not by doing that ? of course you can ! you re five already , and you don t even know that ? i did so know ! it doesn t look like he s carrying anything worth any money"
"what s the matter ? if you want to tell us something , speak up"
"cut it out ! you again ! ? come on , now ! why , you ! stop that ! you children up in the tree , come on down here ! if you do , you ll get new clothes , a clean room , and a hot meal ! really ? dummy ! don t be fooled ! we don t want any of that ! get out of here ! so then , do you plan to go on living in a place like this forever ? you think we re about to put ourselves in your care ! ? we ll go on living by ourselves just fine ! yeah ! yeah ! get out of here ! get out of here ! get out of here ! get out of here ! yay ! and don t come back ! we have a new kid ? apparently , he got shipwrecked out at sea , and washed up here"
"what is it , if you didn t come out here to pee ? i m not an orphan"
"please tell me the way , if you would ! you got it"
"who needs studying ? if you go to the institution , you can do all you like"
"they re coming , they re coming ! here they come ! hey , wait ! hurry up ! o oh , no ! hey , get out ! ow ! ow ! chiko ! come quietly ! damn ! gohan , this way ! but everyone else is ! just come on ! piegero ! gohan ! piegero ! what are you doing ! ? hey , you ! piegero ! why ! ? huh ? why ! ? why did you do that ! ? why ! ? it s for the best ! they re still just little kids and already they re delinquents"
"there s nobody there , even if i did go back"
"why ! ? miserable vegeta ! take responsibility ! are you okay , gohan ? gohan ? piccolo san said long ago that you would be unsuitable as a teacher , father ! that you were too gentle , father ! that you were utterly lacking in the harshness it takes to do this ! that just by seeing how coddled i was , he could tell ! gohan ! i finally understand that ! i have always been spoiled by your gentleness , father ! father , please treat this like you are trying to kill me ! then , even supposing i really do die , that will have been all i was capable of ! and if that is my level , there s no way i could surpass you , father ! if i won t bring myself to die there s no way i can obtain real strength"
i can t ever become a super saiyan ! ka me ha me ha ! ! damned if i m running from this ! i i ve been a pampered child there was the time gohan ! now ! shoot ! then there was the time then there was the time it was my fault for being weak
it was because i depended on everyone else you ve finally become a super saiyan ! just like that
"even if it is his perfect form , it doesn t appear to be anything special"
if you please thank goodness ! kuririn san that was a close call ! i thought you might have had it
"you re just the same as you were when you were getting beaten up ! if that bothers you , then show me the power of this perfect form of yours ! well , maybe just a little bit"
"w what are you doing , trunks ? if you don t hurry up and help him , vegeta really is going to die ! if he dies , he won t be able to give you any business about his pride ! w when dad loses consciousness fighting cell , then i ll step in to help"
"okay ! gohan ! it s about time for us to eat ! right ! after all , if you don t keep your body in good health , i ll get chichi mad at me , too ! right"
"h he s lost consciousness or else he s d d you re tough , huh ? i ll put you out of your misery right now , vegeta"
"all right ! that was a good reading ! but you ve still got a soft touch ! that was close , that was close ! father ! caught you ! oh , my you did good , huh gohan ? yes ! however , we overdid it , didn t we ? i i got all caught up in it , and all we ll have to fix this , or we ll have popo mad at us ! right ! h he did it ! awesome ! that trunks saying he s gotten stronger doesn t even cover it ! he s defeated that monster cell ! kuririn san , watch out ! w what ! ? you re something else , trunks"
"and the reason i can t watch this magnificent fight , it s all due to your ridiculous pride ! for my part , i wouldn t care if you weren t around but as far as trunks goes , that doesn t seem to be so"
"we re just no match for them ! sure is aggravating , huh ? if only father , who died of that heart disease , was still alive at times like these ! knowing father , he would have fought courageously , without hesitation , at any time ! i want to be strong , like father ! gohan san after that , the battle with the artificial humans continued and then , in time , gohan san was killed"
"great power ain t good for nothing if you can t hit your opponent , right ? i couldn t beat that monstrous cell like this"
"if you had more time , is it possible you could up yourselves even more ? how about it ? how should i know ? i couldn t tell unless i tried it"
"martial arts tournament ? what ! ? what was that ! ? what is it ? don t tell me trunks has been killed n no , cell just said he would hold a martial arts tournament ! a martial arts tournament ? i ll hold it in ten days , free of charge ! get as strong as you can and entertain me , if you would"
"if i win , then the next person will fight me , once again"
"if i had to say , enjoying myself is my goal , i suppose"
"if i can just go into that room one more time , we ll get by without having cell ord it over us"
"is bulma san here ? oh , what s that now ? um , i said bulma san yo , krillin ! if you re looking for bulma , she just contacted us"
"why does chi chi san say we can relax ? how should i know ! ? don t you get it ? if he s goin as far as holdin a tenkaichi tournament , then cell is goin to obey the rules ! which means that if he kills you , it ll mean him losin ! we ll get through this without anyone dyin , right ? that s right ! in that case , maybe i ll enter as well ! maybe i ll enter as well"
"if he were to become a martial artist , he d be servin no purpose at all"
"this cake truly is tasty ! isn t it , though ? there s still plenty more , so partake of as much as you like ! i ll take that huge choco creme one this time ! hey , i had my eye on that one ! me first ! the early bird gets the worm , you know ! nyah ! that goes for me too ! enough ! stop poking around , you re getting everything dirty ! i i really have to separate gohan chan from the likes of them soon ! hey now , this is mine here ! oh , my ! i m so pleased that you re enjoying eating it so much ! i still have plenty more , if you like hey , that s mine ! i called this one already ! good grief , oolong and the others are so easygoing right now"
"what is cell dallying around for ? if you re going to show up , then hurry and show up ! trunks , he really told you he d let us know the details via television ? yes , i m sure of it"
"i m not going to allow kakarotto , or anyone else to get in my way ! you ve got a big mouth for someone who got beaten to a pulp by cell , don t you ? what was that ? once i go train in the room of spirit and time another day , i ll settle everything ! there won t be any place for scum like you ! scum , you say ? i call you scum only because you are scum"
"c call the guard ! i will go beyond ! i will go beyond super saiyajin ! gohan ! ? gohan ! gohan chan ! gohan chan ! mother , what are you doing here ? i don t need a reason to be here ! how long are you plannin on stayin in here without doin any studyin ! ? but , mother you re goin to be a great scholar in the future ! but if you do nothin but trainin , then instead of bein a scholar , you re goin to become a delinquent like piccolo ! mother , piccolo san isn t a delinquent delinquent ! delinquent ! absolutely he s a delinquent ! delinquent ! piccolo s a delinquent ! ! sorry , gohan i had stopped her , but she forced her way in"
"it will be different from the tenkaichi tournament , in that if the warriors representing you , ladies and gentlemen , are to lose , then the next warrior will take their place"
"even as great as i am , if i go through too many matches , i may become tired , after all"
"if you concede , or if any part of your body touches outside the ring , you lose"
"and , although it is my intent to hold back , if you are killed , it too constitutes a loss"
"if you don t want things to end up like this , that is"
"yamcha sama ! who could possibly fight against a guy like that ? even vegeta and trunks were no good against him ! and as for goku are you going somewhere , vegeta ? i don t care how many earthlings may die , but i won t be content if i don t kill that scumbag"
"cell said if all the representative warriors were beaten , he would kill every human throughout the world , after all"
"i i know ! what if we were to use the spaceship at bulma s house to escape to some faraway planet ? oolong ! after all , cell might not come chasing after us into space"
"t this is all my fault ! if only , at that time i had destroyed no"
"as your master , i will not allow you to throw your life away ! if you absolutely must do this , then you can wait until the cell games have begun"
you can only go into the room of spirit and time there for two days w what ? what will happen if you go over hours ? exit from room vanishes
"they re in that state as if it were natural for them ! thank you for providing this feast ! ooh , i m full , i m full ! sorry to keep you waiting , trunks"
"do you see something ? out of the way ! we can t go forward , you know ! that s right , that s right ! weren t you coming this way ? if you re not coming , then i ll go to you"
"but right now , he doesn t show that manner at all , huh ? either that , or i wonder if somewhere even now , he s thinking that he d like to beat son kun"
"that s true , huh ? maybe it s a result of history being changed , but if you think about it , this may turn out to be lucky"
"if you ask mom , she ll give you a new one"
i couldn t guess how strong he could become if he felt like it
"but even if we force ourselves to tolerate it , it s not training"
"if you re used to that state , even if the fighting force has increased , only a small burden will be added to the body"
if he has now
piccolo ! come on and go in if you want to
"gohan , if i can come back alive , i ll go fishing with you"
"that s easy for you to say if you ve got enough time to whine , think about what you should do instead"
"please give us the same special training that you gave goku ! goku s special training , huh ? i taught goku absolutely nothing ! what does he mean ! ? if that s the case , there s no reason for us to ve come all the way here at all"
"if this really is the saiyan s planet , we definitely should not take them lightly"
"he vanished ! kuririn ! kuririn ! these guys are invulnerable ! where did they disappear to ! ? kuririn ! kuririn ! kuririn ! let s go save him ! kuririn ! kuririn ! dammit ! at this point , i ll let them have it , even if it costs my own life ! that s it"
"if you do as we tell you , we ll let you stay in the shelter dome"
"even if he does , we should be safe in the shelter dome"
"if we can survive , power and money will be most important and i have both ! how are you ? so it s tao pai pai"
"really ? piccolo , if you re late even a second after hours , i ll break down the door and drag you out"
"what s wrong , piccolo ? you want to beat me with that kind of strength ? damn you ! damn ! i m not done yet ! young man , apart from seasoning , what else do you want to buy ? where have they gone ? big brother , you re so kind"
"shut up ! if you want to stay in my shelter dome , you d better listen to me"
"young man , you ll be in trouble if you get involved"
"no this time i m not kidding ! ! ! i don t care if it s for fighting cell or not ! when we eat , i don t want you to be super saiyajins ! otherwise all the dishes and the whole house will be broken"
"hey , krillin ! hey , goku it would be really nice if gohan was here too"
"to be honest , i don t know if i can beat him"
"if you use son gohan s name , i have no objection"
"where did you come from ? rumors say you came here in a ufo ? what s the real goal of your cell games ? if all the contestants lose , which area will you begin your attack with ? if human beings escape to outer space , will you go after them ? well what a nuisance"
"what ? if i succeed and if one of them can stay on the earth forever , kami sama and the dragonballs can both come back to life"
popo will be happy if you find a new kami sama too
can you detect a ki from such a distance ? maybe i can if it s not too far away
i just wonder if he will succeed where is kaio sama ? i found him
but there was nothing else i could do
"even if we pray , kami sama doesn t exist anymore"
"though it s far away , if i can feel their ki , i ll make it"
"it really takes that long ? right , but if we have the model of the dragonballs , the dragon you had in the past could be brought back to life right away"
"if you make it clear at the very beginning , it s possible"
look forward to it ? but if he said look forward to it then it must be something good
"with the dragonballs , even if cell destroys the earth , i , walker king of gangs , can still survive"
if you don t want to get hurt just leave the dragonballs here
"if you can untangle them by dawn , we ll let you have the dragonballs"
"if you can t , the dragonballs you have will become mine"
we ll be in your way if we keep looking at you
just ask them if you need anything
almost as if in response to the worldwide gaze of his feat
that s great ! everyone on earth will be humiliated if he gets killed
i wonder if he plans to compete in the cell games as well
"excuse me , who are you ? if you are here just for the show , then maybe you should step back a little"
i wouldn t be standing here fixed if it wasn t for you
"even if he does get killed , he can be brought back to life with the dragonballs"
"oh , it looks as if they finally understand"
"well , if he was my opponent , i would beat him in two seconds"
"that s right if it isn t a trick , then what else could it be ? right now , a fully powered battle has begun"
you can t beat me if you continue to rely on other people s techniques
"if i didn t fly into the sky , would you have fired the kamehameha and destroyed the earth ? well , i don t know"
peer at the earth as if you were trying to listen to something faint
"if cell is a monster , then son goku is a monster too"
"if you miss , you ll destroy the earth"
"if he did , the earth would be destroyed"
"if there is no one left to fight in the cell games , then everyone must die"
just go out there and defeat cell if you please
i don t know if i can continue
oh it hurts ! i think i m going to die ! if only i didn t have this stomachache
it would not be fair if gohan wins when cell is in this condition
"if this continues , gohan will gohan san ! gohan ! son gohan , if you have to hate someone , hate your father for being a coward and not fighting"
"even if you trained for years , you still wouldn t be able to kill me"
it doesn t even matter to me if i kill my own brother
want to see some proof ? what are you doing ? stop it that hurts show me ! hurry or else you re going to hit that rock and die ! i incredible
"if this goes on that boy will get killed for sure ! can t someone help him ? get angry now ! show me your real power ! he hit cell ! son gohan , i must make you angry no matter what"
"who else can save earth ? son gohan , show me your hidden power ! that s the same beam freeza used ! gohan , hang in there ! what s wrong ? does it hurt ? get mad , then"
"remember this ! even if he is the strongest fighter , he s still just a child ! that s it ! i m going ! krillin , give me a senzu ! right ! what a stubborn kid"
i guess you need to see someone else get hurt first
"if inflicting pain on you won t work , i ll inflict it on your friends ! get ready"
to kill son kun maybe ? i don t know if that s the only reason
it s okay to kill them if you want
"piccolo ! krillin san ! s stop ! except for trunks , nobody else can be brought back with the dragonballs"
"but if you don t hurry up and show your true power , it will be too late"
"if i really have incredible powers hidden within me , i want to release it"
"if i , the champion , ran away , i d be a laughing stock"
kill them all if you have to
"why can t you understand that ! ? i wish i could fight with them too if i could , but only gohan can defeat cell"
"hey cameraman , don t miss this ! the camera isn t working anymore ! what ! ? this is the story of the century ! do something ! fix it ! he s fighting against the cell juniors as if they were nothing"
can gohan actually beat cell ? damn it ! now there s someone else stronger than me besides kakarotto ? father here s a senzu
"he s alive ! what ? ! krillin , what are you going to do with that android ? hurry up and kill her if she s still alive"
but can son gohan beat him again ? i don t know if even gohan san can do it this time surprised ? well i ll tell you what happened
"i have to make a play on words ! ? are you getting cold feet ? if the pun is not at an adequate enough level , i won t laugh at it"
"if that s so , then give up , and go home ! m my futon flew away , gone ! your futon flew away gone ! ? just a little more ! my feline has gone supine ! my stylus is sightless ! ah , you laughed ! kaio sama , you laughed ! my futon flew away , gone ! you re no slouch at this , huh ? you re a pro , aren t you ? very well , i will give you my training"
me training you on this planet for days will have the same value as if you trained for a thousand years on earth
"really ! ? however even if you do train with me , there s no guarantee that you will be able to beat the saiyans"
"which means that if you cannot at least surpass me , it will be impossible for you to beat the saiyans"
"catch bubbles kun here , if you can"
"for the time being , until you can move fast enough to do that , nothing else will matter"
"if you can t , then go home right now"
"so young if you set your mind to it , there are any number of fun things to do here"
"if we re able to defeat the saiyans , your father s turn comes next"
"if i hadn t been such an idiot , i could have protected the earth"
"if you want to defeat son goku , we can do that"
"if you don t , i ll use the controller"
"but if this is what you think , then avenge my death and destroy cell ! yes ! gohan he s going to strike ! ka me ha me so you want to strike now ? what s wrong , kami sama ? gohan san , good luck"
"a warrior must die in the arena , huh ? even if it s certain death , i d rather die trying"
i would ve given up long ago if i were the person i used to be
"is that so ? well , i m going to see if trunks is alright"
"if so , that would make you look like a fool of course it would"
"heh , i guess all of that commotion has made me really hungry ! do you have anything good to eat , kaio sama ? what do you mean by that ? ! i don t know if there is anything for you to eat ! what am i supposed to do about it ? ! is that so ? umm i m still hungry but we re dead ! i guess i ll just find something"
"well , if you say so that bastard bulma"
"if it s within my power , i will grant it"
"if that s ok honestly then , what s the problem ? tell me"
"he treats him like a little brother , doesn t he ? or maybe he acts as if he s the leader"
"gohan , behind you ! you want to eat this fish , don t you ? well , get it if you can ! you re a wimp , aren t you ? what don t you understand ? what a big wimp"
", do you mind if i take him down ? i m sick of him ruining my fun already"
you have to wait for your turn if you want to be judged
i wouldn t know if i wasn t dead
"if you can run faster than me , you re qualified for the tournament"
do you hear me ? you carry all my hope ! you ll be sorry if you lose
"you garbage ! you ve made me lose ! now dai kaio won t train you ! stop whining ! you re really good ! if i had to stay in the water , i might have lost ! i ll win next time"
"a bet ? if paikuhan loses , i ll give you the west kaio planet"
"what ? you ll give me your kaio planet ? what if goku loses ? okay , then i ll have to give you the north kaio planet"
"okay , if goku loses , i ll be your servant"
"okay , if goku loses then i will win your life , but you re already dead , eh ? in that case , i d like you to be my servant"
"son goku , please get in the ring if you re here ! stop eating ! you re in the final round ! so , son goku is eating ? how silly ! what a strange guy ! wait , i haven t finished yet ! is he just being calm , or is he an idiot ? one , two , one , two"
keep running ! you ll be punished if you stop ! please start the fight ! why didn t you dodge ? i see
"a few years okay ! i ll wait it out ! great i have been lazy with my training lately , so if i have to fight with goku chan , i ll get tired very fast"
"kaio sama , i am absolutely infuriated ! if it s okay with you , i would like to take this disparager down a peg"
"everyone , get better ! goku , i can t wait to see you again ! hammer in hand , two weeks went by almost there ! he s persistent ! all right ! oh , no ! brace yourself , gregory ! i did it ! it d hurt if i hit you as hard as i could , after all"
"mom and bulma san both told me that if people found out who i was , it would cause a big commotion"
"damn ! he did it ! it s a home run ! the runner on third s off his base ! in this case , if i throw the ball to third , he ll be out"
"if you don t dodge , you ll die"
"if his house is that far away , why isn t he going by car or jet ? what ? cities are tiring"
"if i transform , i can fly to school by myself a lot faster"
"we ll have a race if you think i m lying , kintoun"
"do you mind if we continue class , son gohan kun ? yes ! hello , this is videl"
come immediately ! there s a bus jacking going on ! a gang of three has taken a senior citizen tour bus hostage and are threatening the lives of their hostages if their demands are not met
satan ? this could be dangerous if she s like mr
"if you sleep in and are late for school tomorrow , don t blame me"
"what if she tells someone else ! ? son gohan ! son gohan kun , go stand in the hallway"
"you promise not to tell anyone my secret if i date you , right ? well , uh you want to see a movie ! ? i m so happy"
please don t tell anyone else ! okay
"if i open that , that water ll come out , right ? i don t know if that will be enough water to put out the fire"
sometimes when i don t have anything else to wear i hate you gohan ! maybe i should have ignored angela san i ve loved you for a long time
i ll be late if i don t hurry
"if our boss shows up , the police won t be able to do a thing about him"
"i thought that if you were the great saiyaman , you d easily be able to defeat them , so i stayed back and watched"
"if i was a little later , you could have been in a lot of trouble"
"if you don t , the mayor will die"
fight him ! ? i don t care if that damned mr
"what do you think mayor ? if you don t want your mayor to die , you ll bring satan here to fight me ! have you contacted mr"
if mr
he ll fight you if you beat me first
"so if i beat this girl , it s the same as if i were to beat mr"
"i can t watch this enough ! videl , if you want to become a real champion like me , you should train more"
"if i had gone to that competition i would have surely won ! son son goku ? goten , weren t you able to find him ? i wonder if something happened to him"
"wait ! they must be looking for him right now ! if that s the case , something terrible might happen ! behave yourself"
"i have to take him back to his parents ! if i don t , something terrible might happen"
"give me that monster peacefully ! if you don t , i ll have to take him from you with force ! if you lose to me , don t blame me if i take your mask off , great saiyaman"
"drat stop this videl san ! why ? are you afraid of me ! ? if you think that i m weak because i m a girl , you re in for a big surprise ! i want to see how strong you are , but i also want to see who you really are"
"what are you talking about ! ? if i don t take chibi back , something really bad s going to happen to this city"
"if i give them back chibi , they should calm down ! hurry"
"damn it ! next time i m going to capture the whole damn family ! if you try that , i ll make you pay ! you picked the wrong monster"
"if i wanted my friends to have normal lives , i had to hide how strong i am your friends ? you re the golden haired warrior too aren t you ! ? you re wrong there ! really ? really"
"but if you show up as the great saiyaman , no one ll know it s you ! but do you want me to tell everyone ? okay , i ll go"
it wouldn t be fair if you can fly and i can t
"but she figured out who i am by my voice and stuff if i don t go to the competition too , she s going to reveal my identity"
"vegeta san , if you don t want your identity known , you have to wear a costume like this"
"cut ! cut ! cut ! hey kid , if you get in front of the camera like that , how are we supposed to get this show done ? are you talking to me ? of course i m talking to you"
is there anyone else there ? what a brat ! why are you pretending to be the great saiyaman like that anyway ? pretending ? oh well
"what ? i thought if the real great saiyaman saw this , that is what he d think"
"what ? him ? if we change his clothes , he ll be perfect"
"and this ll be the first time that goten ll see father ! but will mother allow me to enter the tenkaichi budoukai ? if i m going to have to enter , i ll want to win and since i ve ignored my body , i ll have to take a break from school and train what ! ? goku s coming back from the dead to enter the tenkaichi budoukai ! ? why d you wait so long to tell me this big news ! ? isn t that good goten ? you ll be able to meet and see your father for a whole day ! but i ve gotten older"
"goten , what are you doing ? if you don t hurry , i ll leave you behind"
"well , if goku says he wants to go back on that day , that s fine with me"
"goten , what are you doing ? we didn t come here to play ! we came to train ! why don t you go somewhere and train or something ? if you keep bothering me , i won t be able to train"
throw ! what ? this close ? it would be okay even if you were closer
"brother , if you re going to fly , teach me how to too"
"you have great martial arts potential yourself ! you really surprised me ! i didn t know you were that good ! if you train hard , you might be able to go to the tenkaichi budoukai yourself"
these little kids are going to catch up and pass me if i m not careful
"if that s it , i guess it s okay"
"why didn t you say this from the beginning ? i don t know anything about this kind of magic ! huh ? you don t know about ki ? now what am i going to do ? hey , you mean if you don t have any ki , you can t fly in the air ? it s okay"
don t blame me if you get hurt
"you see , if it s long , it s easier to grab and it could get in your eyes"
"if you hit me on the face even once , i ll take you to the amusement park"
"also , if he found out i was coming to a boy s house , he d get very angry"
"hey , what would you do if someone beat your father ? would that be too much of a shock to you ? of course not"
okay ! okay ! if i beat mr
aren t you entering yamcha san ? why should i ? i would only get embarrassed if i entered
"if you turn into a super saiyajin , people will go , ah that s the group from the cell games ! it would be bothersome if that happened tv cameras and stuff"
"okay , as long as no one else goes super saiyajin , the fights will still be the same"
i wonder if goku is already here
"thanks baba ! hey , if we don t sign up for the competition soon , we ll be too late"
it s too bad for everyone else that we re here
i don t care if you re dead or alive
"put on a great show ! get in line if you want my autograph ! i ll give it away free to the first people ! satan ! satan ! satan ! satan ! satan ! satan ! idiots only quit when they re dead , but i don t even think that will work against him"
"if i can take off his cap , i ll know who he is ! let s go"
"if you slip up , it wouldn t be too hard to destroy the very planet you re trying to protect"
"if you can help it , don t use it at all , although i will permit you to use it one time , if there s nothing else you can do"
"i wonder if he s gone senile hey ! get the dragonballs ready , now ! that was amazing , kaio sama ! i got right through to him ! well , sure you did"
"i m going to go at them as hard as i can ! watch me ! thanks for everything , kaio sama ! if i die , i ll come see you again"
"no small matter ! ! little trunks aw , he wrecked it i i m going home , if he ll be competing"
"oh , it s lil trunks ! give him your best ! ah , if he gives his best , things could get ugly"
"if we don t finish up our preliminary soon , we won t be able to see him"
"both contestants have fought their way here with overpowering strength ! and what s more , both of them are good friends ! the final round is about to begin ! um , is it ready ? we re in a hurry here ! oh , we ve just now got it working ! really ? well then , if i may no taking cuts ! wait your turn ! uh , but i no way ! return to your place in line ! uh , now , hold on we re in a hurry ! no , ma am"
"very well , what else can i do ? i ll watch their match for a bit"
"hurry and say you give up ! if i grab you any tighter , you ll die ! n no way ! it looks as though trunks wins this one"
"goten what ? if i really wanted to , i could win without even using my left arm"
"really ? you have to now ! you promised me ! okay ? and now , following such a tense match , it s time for this delightful attraction ! we will now have trunks kun , the winner of the junior division , fight against the world champion , mister satan ! satan ! satan ! satan ! so , what do you suppose that guy will do now ? what if he decides to cry trick again ? there s no way he can match up against trunks"
"just how long will trunks kun s power hold out against mister satan ? satan ! satan ! satan ! you know , he s an incredible little boy , huh ? i don t suppose even the great mister satan can stand waiting for this ! w what if he decides to get serious on me ? don t be silly ! joking ! i m joking ! what can i do ? i m going to die ! would you like to take a little break first ? i m fine"
"really ? then , without further ado , mister satan ! if you please ? go ahead , mister satan ! mister satan ! world s greatest ! who is this youngster , who challenges the world champion , mister satan ! ? satan ! satan ! satan ! it s you , then ! ? i hope you re ready ! w what should i do ? if this is a dream , hurry and wake up ! this old guy is the world champion ? i wouldn t believe it for a second"
i wonder if he s stronger than dad
"what can i do ? what can i do ? if i lose to a kid , my reputation will be damaged ! that s it ! my opponent is a kid ! i can just pretend to lose to him on purpose ! that s good ! that s what i ll do ! so , then"
"well then , the match between the junior champion trunks kun and mister satan ! please begin ! all right ! so , bring it on ! oh ? mister satan has stuck out his face , as if to say hit me ! such poise ! such poise , mister satan ! way to go ! good luck , kid ! p p papa ! you idiot ! you ve got to pull your punch more than that ! papa ! you got me ! you sure are strong"
it would be unfavorable if i went by piccolo
"what is it about you saiyans and your stomachs ? saiyans ? kuririn san ! gotcha , gotcha ! i won t say anything else ! i m full ! i m full ! thanks for the hospitality ! the food on this side is yummy indeed ! you didn t eat anything"
"if things go well , i hope we may end up competing against each other"
"by all means , if i could shake your hand"
"well , if you will excuse me"
"that means he s one of them ! how about it ? don t you think we can use him ? in that outfit , no one would know if we were inside ! probably"
"kami sama , i plead with you ! please don t let me face one of these guys in the first round ! kuririn , when you say kami sama , it s dende ! ah , that s right ! but that s okay ! kami sama ! dende sama ! except for those two , there ain t anyone else all that seems all that great"
"contestant killa , number ! contestant killa , number ! oh ! the match ups for the first round are underway ! next is contestant kibit , if you please ? um , number"
"hey , goten , what was the name of this guy ? i wouldn t know something like that ! next , contestant spopovitch , if you please ? er"
"contestant spopovitch ! if you would ? hey , there s no answer ! could he be this spopovitch ? that s it , it has to be ! hurry , let s go ! yeah"
if only that abnormal looking jerk had answered sooner ! next is contestant jewel
"if you thrill her just a little bit , i bet you could get her to marry you in a second , gohan ! h how can you ! ? we re not even really seeing each other ! well , not to worry , not to worry contestant punter , number"
"if after minutes has passed and the match has yet to be decided , a judgement will be imposed by the referee"
"and so , both contestants , if you would"
"what s the matter , piccolo ? did he say something untoward to you ? if he did , want me to go over and snap at him ? after all , piccolo , you did use to be kami over the earth ! s stop ! don t say a thing ! please ! don t say anything ! got it ! ? that young man is k kaioshin sama ! ? i ve never even had the honor of meeting him"
"that s really mister satan s daughter ? so ? she s pretty good , isn t she ? no way ! whoa ! contestant spopovitch once again rises as if nothing has happened ! what toughness he is displaying ! this proves to be an unexpected development"
"according to the rules of this tournament , as contestant videl has killed her opponent , she is disqualif ? w w w what s this ! ? his neck has returned to normal ! how can this possibly be ! ? w what is this ? goku is right"
"w who were you expecting would give up ? what ! ? t this is terrible ! what kind of guy is he ? stop , already ! if this keeps up , it ll mess up videl s face ! it doesn t look like she s going to get off as easy as just that ! hmm , they say my first round opponent is a woman , so when i win , i d better not strike too much of a guts pose or it ll look like i m being sarcastic this would be playing it up too much to the spectators"
"don t you think it best if you concede ? n no way ! i ll never concede ! w why are you being so stubborn ! ? you re really going to get killed here ! he s not holding back because you re a girl , he doesn t have that kind of compassion ! that s awful ! how could he ! ? v videl ! you bastard ! damn you ! any more and i ll arrest you ! h hey , gohan , relax ! it s all right , she ain t going to die"
"t this is terrible ! contestant spopovitch , i can t believe these are the actions of a human being ! a ain t there anythin left that can be done ? if this keeps up , that girl will be dead before she marries gohan ! gohan no ! i don t i don t want to lose ! why you you re going to pay now"
"if father comes back , that s where i ll be"
"if anything happens to videl , someone s going to answer to me ! mister satan ! mister satan ! this is nathie , the reporter"
"you have to learn more by watching me , and becoming a better example of a good boy to everyone ! what ! ? don t make me laugh ! have you had enough yet ? dammit ! contestant mister satan wins ! videl , you must have taken spopovitch too lightly , and just underestimated him , right ? i ve told you since long ago that carelessness is your greatest enemy , indeed what else could i do ? d don t tell me this is because you ve started associating with that weakling boy ! i absolutely will not allow it ! gohan kun ! what ! ? i hope videl s okay"
"lousy great saiyaman ! who the hell are you ! ? if only my camera hadn t broken back then ! i did it ! i may not have seen clearly with my naked eye , but my camera has surely captured his uncovered face for me ! i , shapner sama , have uncovered the great saiyaman s true identity ! damn , this time i ll uncover his true identity for sure ! shapner ! shapner ! do you think videl is okay ? sure she s okay"
what could he be doing ? he d be more charming if he acted like the dead man that he is and held back on his appetite a bit
"doesn t matter to me if he s kibit or shibit dead , my gohan will win ! that s true"
"the fourth match is between contestant kibit and contestant great er , pardon me can i ask you to wait a little while longer ? it doesn t matter if it s just a moment or two , but there s a miraculous medicine that can heal videl san"
"ah , is that so ? v very well , if it ll only be a moment"
"if they learn my true power , it ll turn into a big deal , and it will become harder for me to go to school and places , like bulma san said"
"that s why i had the disguise he doesn t seem to be the kind of opponent i can get to let me win with the right kind of trickery turn yourself into this super saiyan business ! i want to test you , to see if you will be of help to us if the situation arises ! huh ? h how do you know about super saiyans ? a and what do you mean , be of help to you ? you will know the answer to that in any case shortly"
"if you would be so kind what ! ? what is this about ? well , turn ! damn , i i have no choice"
"after them ? if it is all right with you , you may all please come with me"
"plus , i just gotta know what s happening here ! gohan kun ! are you okay ? shake it off ! hurry and get a stretcher ready ! s say , isn t that videl ? it is , right ? it couldn t be ! i wonder if i m just having a bad dream ow ! you re going , goku ? w well , maybe i ll go too"
"we ll fight later for sure , even if it ain t at the tenkaichi tournament"
piccolo ! you can assure me that it s okay if i leave gohan in your hands ? it s all right
"well , make sure you don t kill anyone in your matches ! see ya ! if things get nasty , you get out of there ! right ! w where is everyone going ? you ll find out when you go too"
"she s with that kid again ! dammit ! i don t care if he did heal videl s injuries with that mysterious bean , i absolutely forbid them to associate ! say , can i come along with you ? there are lots of things i want to know"
"i m coming , even if you say no"
"if i cannot borrow your powers , we will not likely win not win ? you mean against those two ? no"
"if we go at it too excessively , we won t be able to sell this planet for a high price"
"even if i did go , i d just be in the way"
"this ain t no ordinary case ! who is that ? i knew it ! so this was the saiyan s doin ! are they tellin me i gotta fight someone with this kinda power ! ? h hey , you ! what are you doing there ! ? a are you the one who did this ! ? you dimwit ! there ain t no way i coulda done this ! if i had this sorta power , i wouldn t be so scared , y know ! ? you know something , don t you ! ? chief ! hey ! this was done by aliens , who re called saiyans ! w what ! ? aliens ! ? they re fixin to exterminate everyone on earth ! every last one ! my boys re fightin em right now for ya , to make sure they don t get their way"
"even if you are namekian , by yourself , you re no more than a housefly to us"
"you ll talk , even if i have to force it out of you ! miserable fools ! you plan on facing us with that kind of battle power ? nappa , take off your scouter"
it d be nice if he didn t keep such tough people at his side
"v videl san you okay ? y yeah if this majin was so terrible , why did you leave him alone when you killed babidi s dad way back then ? it could not be helped"
"if we had caused him any trauma without being precise , we might have accidentally broken the seal"
"if you find goten or mother there , explain to them what s happening here"
"if you come back safely , i want to date you and stuff ah , we ve caught up ! father ! oh , it s gohan ! hurry on up here ! gohan , we ve been waiting for you"
"to think of having babidi and dabura together are you trying to say our chances of winning have all but disappeared ? hmph , if majin boo is revived , it s the end of the world , huh ? i won t have it ! i won t be beat by them ! t this is going to be pretty dangerous , all right"
"in all seven of them even if we can t make use of kaioshin and kibit s energy , three of them appear to have the wonderful energy necessary for majin boo s revival"
"we ve been found out ! kibit ! kibit san ! dammit ! watch out ! oh , no ! dabura s saliva is what ! ? why , you ! hey ! wha ? kuririn san ! piccolo ! kuririn ! piccolo ! what the hell s happening ? s stone anyone who comes in contact with dabura s saliva turns to stone ! what ! ? piccolo ! you mustn t ! you must not touch him ! why not ! ? if you touch them and somehow break them , there will be no way to return them to normal again"
"this isn t big brother s fault ! if it wasn t for that , the matches would have continued"
"stop saying bad things about big brother ! ow ! now you ve done it , you ! ah , ouch ! what , what ! ? what s the matter ? are you all right , mighty mask san ? are you hurt ? no ! i i m fine ! snap out of it ! what about you ! hold still ! ow ! watch where you re going ! i wonder if he s feeling okay kuririn san piccolo san kaioshin sama , you just said that if we broke them , we couldn t return them to normal , didn t you ? well that must mean there s some way to return them to normal , ain t there ? i it s just not unless dabura were to die what now , that s a simple enough way , ain t it ? father , let s go ! we are going after all , aren t we ? we have to save kuririn san and piccolo san ! naturally ! let s go ! ah , wait just a moment ! we can t let ourselves cater to the enemy s strategy ! once we enter the enemy ship , we play right into their hands ! we have to wait and watch a little while longer ! i can t just leave kuririn and piccolo like that ! me either ! sorry , man"
"hmph ! if we had to , we could always destroy the whole ship"
"if they gathered this great an energy in such a short time , i guess i shouldn t have killed them"
"if all goes well , majin boo s revival can be realized within the day"
"there are still many stages left , and if the worst comes to pass , i am still here for you , am i not ? recess , huh ? i wonder what s goin on"
"this way ! this way ! this way ! this way ! in here , in here ! all right , no one else is in here ! there he is"
"isn t this contestant mighty mask s ? where could he have gone ? no , uh , i mean mighty mask san ! ? where are you ? oh , he s in the shower ? well then , mighty mask san ! no ! no , no ! he ll be very angry with you if you peep in on him ! mm ? ah , right ! masked contestants hate having people see their real face more than anything"
"fight to your heart s content ! yes , babidi sama hey ! ready yet ? hurry up and come on out ! this is senseless ! why don t we knock our way through the floor and head down there all at once ? you must not ! as i said before , if we provide any strong shock , then even if he s not at full power , majin boo might hmph , at this rate , how do we know that majin boo isn t all that great either ? the same way that dabura scum isn t"
"however , if they fight inside the spaceship , and supply any strong shock to it , majin boo might emerge with his power only partly intact"
"if we re going to do this at all , we want him at his original strength , don t we ? quite so"
"tasty ! i ve never eaten light so delicious and with such volume before ! you eat it ? m maju yakon eats the energy of light ! goku san , your energy as a super saiyan is undoubtedly his greatest food ! father , you can t turn super saiyan any more ! apparently that guy eats the energy of light ! that s right ! that was the best light just now ! if it were possible , i wish you could treat me yet again ! you re a strange one ! fine ! i will treat you some more ! what ? here goes ! what is he thinking ? father ! i ll fight too ! with the two of us , we can win without turning super saiyan ! nah , i ll do this by myself"
"d dabura ! if you are beaten , then it s all over ! you re sure you have a chance of winning ? chance of winning ? i am dabura , king of the demon realm ! come three thousand kili , come four thousand kili , there does not exist a man in all the world with greater power than i ! in the second stage , goku also easily beats down maju yakon"
"besides , it wouldn t be fair , would it ? unfair ? yeah ! if only me and vegeta get to fight alone , while gohan has to fight with everyone else he s right ! kaioshin sama , please , leave this up to me"
"right ! he s sure set his mind to it ! if he goes all out , it will be a simple matter for him to beat all three of them"
i wonder if no
"if that s the case , i ll just head on home"
"if i were to be worried over such a thing , i would not be able to call myself a true champion"
i wonder if it ll be startin before goku sa and gohan chan come back
"hmm , we won t be able to help it if it does"
"what do you say ? after the match , just the two of us could get something to eat , or get lost , you eyesore ! w what did you say ! ? so then , the final round will have no time limit ! let us have this five man battle royale begin at once ! i if you re coming , then come on ! i ll take you ! well , bring it on ! that woman ! how dare she refuse my explicit invitation ! rotten mighty mask ! when did you start having such a sassy mouth ? damn you ! begin the match ! oh , what is this ? very early into the match , contestant jewel and contestant killa have both dropped out ! that lady has a cute face , and she s incredible ! contestant mighty mask is pretty good too ! yea ! mommy , nice going ! stick it to em , no"
"fight back ! i know ! here goes ! they re good ! incredible ! if goku sa isn t fightin , we ll cheer for no"
"san ! mommy , hang tough ! hmm ? mm ? can it be ? idiot , not that way ! right ! right ! easy for you to say ! oh no ! we re going to lose ! okay , then ! they re flying ! the two of them are flying through the air ! just what is going on here ? that does it , let s break through here ! you must not do such a thing ! we can t just wait here forever ! b but you can t just break it ! if we irritate them for no reason , it is instead likely to place us in danger ! they re getting impatient ! is dabura ready yet ? sir , he s still in the meditation chamber"
"hang in there , trunks kun ! goten ! you haven t been doing anything for a while now ! kick or something ! but i can t see so well ! this is no time to be saying that ! if this works out , i m willing to give you one more toy ! really ! ? yea ! okay , i ll try it ! here goes , goten ! yeah ! strange i can t read his movements trunks kun ! that was some good punching ! yep ! goten , you keep it up too ! let s go ! she s losing ! she ll be okay ! hey ! what s wrong , no"
"b but , will she be all right ? relax ! if we control it right , she won t die"
"! whoever wins this is the victor ! hang in there , mister satan ! mommy , good luck ! w what do i do ? this time for sure , i really am dead ! so late i wonder if they re coming out soon oh , dabura ! my apologies for the delay"
"do you want to win ? n no , enough ! i ve had enough , please don t do anything terrible what s wrong , satan ! get her ! if so , i don t mind letting you win that s ticklish hm ? w what did you just i said i was going to let you win ! in exchange , you will hand over to me million zeni"
"if only i get beaten up , it would look suspicious , right ? b but that s all i can take all right ! then grab hold and throw me ! then use your finishing technique for the big finish"
"if you don t pay me , i ll kill you ! y yes , i understand"
"of course , in his case , we never know what might happen if he launches into a rage , do we ? no wonder these three are so composed ! if it comes to it , they can release incredible power , like goku san momentarily displayed before"
"if you can , why don t you fight in a different place ? ah , certainly"
"madoshi ! ? majin ! ? y yeah d did you hear that , goten ? y yeah ! sounds like fun ! yeah ? yeah ? yeah ? that way , right ! ? that s right , that s right ! i can feel our papas ki ! j just a second , you guys ! don t tell me you re thinking of going there ? hurry ! if we don t get there fast , our papas will have already beaten their foes ! no , no ! i wanna see , i wanna see ! i want to see this majin boo guy ! go ! ! yahoo ! you ve got to be kidding ! you fool ! what ? gohan s power is at full throttle ! the real fight begins now !"
"where are you looking ? you re mine ! what ? has he really done it this time ? dammit , what are you doing , dabura ! ? you ve got to do more and more , greater damage ! o once majin boo returns , those guys won t matter ! gohan ! what ! ? dammit , this is irritating ! all right , i m going to put an end to this ! no you don t vegeta ! let him do this ! it s not exactly like he s completely losing there ! all this playing around isn t important ! i want to put and end to this so i can hurry and settle my score with you ! that s the whole reason i went to all the trouble of going to that ridiculous tournament ! if it doesn t look like he s going to make any more progress , i ll end this in an instant ! babidi sama , please return us to the spaceship immediately ! i have made a quite grand discovery ! grand discovery ? it will mean the revival of majin boo w what ! ? is this true , dabura ? quite possibly"
"i i get it ! we don t even have to fight them , we can turn them on each other and just take in their energy ! if we do that majin boo will be revived ! bravo ! bravo , dabura ! dabura has discovered the evil in vegeta s heart"
"vegeta , prince of destruction , revived ! ! intrusion at the tournament dabura someone supposed to be a demonic king , has abandoned the fight ! ? what on earth could his intention be ? it s you whose intention i want to know ! how could you fail to take down a guy of his level ! ? if you were even a paltry member of our fighting race , once you started a fight , you d make sure to take your opponent s last breath from them ! ! you re all too soft ! ! every one of you , fighting behind the mask of justice , it disgusts me ! it s power that commands the fight ! the strong are the only ones who survive , while the weak die ! power is everything ! but take a look at piccolo and them ! it s only because they were weak that they were turned to stone ! hmph ! they re a disgrace ! that s right ! if i d only defeated dabura , piccolo san and kuririn san would have been returned to normal let it stand at that , vegeta"
"like i told you , kakarrot ! i want to put an end to this playing around so i can hurry up and settle my score with you ! dammit , i m at the limits of my patience ! never mind babidi , and never mind the majin ! i m going to vaporize this whole spaceship ! this is where it ends ! that s reckless , vegeta san ! if you do such a thing , majin boo will be revived ! majin boo is a monster who does nothing but create destruction and slaughter again and again ! he is quite literally a demonic being , as four of the kaioshin were no match for him ! shut up ! if majin boo is revived , then mankind no , all living things will be put to death , and the earth will unmistakably be turned into a planet of death ! be silent ! how many people are killed what may happen to the earth it s no concern of mine ! what kind of person are you ? why don t you cut it out , vegeta ! ? kakarrot ! still , something strange has happened , huh ? yeah"
"we re going to have you serve us ! vegeta san ! dammit ! i knew it ! kaioshin sama , what on earth is ? vegeta san ! shake it off ! babidi is attempting to use the evil in your heart ! babidi using the evil in his heart ? that s right ! madoshi babidi can manipulate the evil hearted at will ! you can t mean the warrior dabura found is ? vegeta san , empty your mind ! you must not think of anything ! w worthless fool ! that s easy for you to say ! good , good ! you re ours now ! all right , while we re at it , let s also draw out his hidden power , beyond his limits ! w what s this ? incredible power ! vegeta san ! no , vegeta san ! don t let that guy manipulate you ! gohan ! vegeta san what a ki ! i can t get near it ! babidi , you ! vegeta san ! vegeta hey , vegeta ! please , wait ! it s too late ! i it can t be i m champion ! way to go , mister satan ! yea , mister satan ! you re so cool ! we cannot allow you in the ring ! please go back ! everyone , please return and sit in your seats at once ! sit down , if you please ! vegeta ! vegeta san , snap out of it ! vegeta san ! i never i never expected babidi to go about setting us up against each other ! great , great ! he is now my servant ! why don t i let them fight somewhere nice ? papparapa ! w what ! ? he s about to move us to another location"
"this is no apparition , this is unmistakably the tournament grounds ! w what s with them ? they just suddenly appeared ! goku ! no doubt about it , it s goku and the others ! what s happening here ? goku sa ! and gohan too ! vegeta ! unbelievable ! now they come back to the tenkaichi tournament , when the winner s already been decided ! what am i goin to do about the family budget ? i know ! just beat up mister satan now and take the prize money ! that s preposterous ! preposterous ! ? if he beats the champion to a pulp in front of everyone here , no one s goin to object ! i i suppose that s true hmm ? w wait a second , there s something strange here"
"you re a bit late , aren t you , party of son san ? where on earth have you been ? watch out ! so , what was his name again ? er right , right , right ! vegeta ! take the energy from those guys ! battle with all your might ! you can even kill them if you want ! silence ! my only objective is kakarrot ! i don t care about anyone else ! vegeta you how about that guy ? he still isn t completely under my control ! this is a first ! well , i guess it s okay"
"what s the matter with you , vegeta ! ? what kind of guy do you suppose this majin is ? i wonder if he s strong"
"that can t be answer me , vegeta ! ! help me ! please stop , vegeta san ! out of the way ! ! stay back , small fry ! this fight is between me and kakarrot ! vegeta , no matter what ? you mustn t , goku san ! if you were to fight here , you would play right into babidi s hands ! your energy would be absorbed , and majin boo will most assuredly be revived ! vegeta , you let yourself fall under babidi s spell and lost your self control , and did all this , all in order to get me serious"
"am i wrong ? what s that ? if i hadn t done all this , you wouldn t have fought me ! in only one day , you ll disappear from this world"
"and yet all this gets in the way ! s so for that just for that , you ve done this foolish thing ? foolish thing ! ? foolish thing , you say ! ! ? this is everything to me ! it does not matter to me what happens with majin boo or anything else ! he he surpassed my strength ! he is a saiyan , same as me , yet he outpaced me ! me ! the prince , at the height of his overwhelming power ! i i ve even had my life saved by him ! i cannot forgive him for that ! absolutely not ! ! babidi ! change us to a place where no one else is around ! i have decided to fight vegeta ! look , we did it ! we did it ! just a moment ! if you re going to confront him no matter what , then do it after you have defeated me ! f father ! understood"
"if we are fortunate , we may be able to prevent his revival entirely"
"even if kaioshin does come , he can do nothing so long as i am here"
"besides , is it not what you wanted ? to see kaioshin die before your very eyes ? u unbelievable ! to think there s a person that could defy babidi while being controlled by him ! so this is how badly you wanted to settle things between us , vegeta ? if anything , would it not be better for us to open the door and allow kaioshin to come here ? it would not do if he forces it open and traumatizes the ship , forcing majin boo s return before he attains his perfect power , would it ? indeed"
he opened it himself ! he would be disserved if his spaceship were damaged
"get angry , gohan ! get angry , remember what happened when you fought cell , and call up all the power you possess ! g get angry ? if you do , you can t lose to any kind of guy in the whole world ! any kind of guy , you hear ? right"
"this is almost as if the end of the world were approaching , it s such a spectacle"
"does this mean they don t feel it necessary to buy any more time ? let s go , onto where majin boo s ball is ! right ! very soon , you will see the death of kaioshin before your very eyes ! i m counting on it , dabura ! you defy me ? you defy me , kakarrot ! ? what are you doing , goten ! ? if we re not quick , we won t be able to see majin boo ! but what is it ? i have to go pee ! go pee ? just hold it in ! i can t ! after all , i haven t gone the whole time since the tournament started ! i m going to leak out ! i can t do anything with you ! okay , over there ! go do it over there ! hurry ! yeah ! trunks kun ! me too ! mine s shooting out so far ! look at mine ! whee ! there it goes ! there it goes ! ah , that startled me ! we have to hurry ! let s fly , goten ! yeah ! w what force ! vegeta s raised his power quite a bit , huh ? vegeta what s the matter , weren t you going to end this quickly ? that s what i m trying to do"
"if majin boo is revived , this earth will be destroyed in a flash ! right"
"but no matter what may come , we are going to beat you , and stop majin boo s revival ! you think it will be that easy ? papparapa ! well , dabura ? just to be sure , let me ask you if you re certain you can beat that earthling"
"do whatever you like with him ! you may turn him to stone like those others , or mess him up even worse if you like ! right ! you ve gotten strong , kakarrot ! this is the result of your training in the other world ? you too , vegeta ! you re much stronger than i d thought ! kaioshin , i m so happy you came ! now i can finally take revenge , you see ! long ago , you killed my papa"
"if i m not careful as i attack , i ll be done in by his magic ! damn ! to think i had a hard time with this guy while we re here like this , majin boo is rapidly collecting energy ! get angry ! get angry , gohan ! f father ! get angry , remember what happened when you fought cell , and call up all the power you possess ! if you do , you can t lose to any kind of guy in the whole world ! any kind of guy , you hear ? i am angry ! i am angry , but i can t bring myself to the way it was then the way it was when i fought cell ka me ha me ha ! ! dammit ! i ll just have to do it now ! i it can t be ! it can t be ! not this soon ! what is it ? what is the matter , babidi sama ? f full full power ! he s at full power ! majin boo is at full power ! ! he s at full power ! he s at full power ! majin boo is finally revived ! i impossible ! why has goku san s damage energy collected as suddenly as this ? t that s why ! father is fighting at a level even beyond super saiyan ! perhaps as his and vegeta san s two incredible powers collide , the damage done is also extraordinary ! ah , dammit ! we did it , dabura ! yes , babidi sama"
"it s he who can overcome and be victorious that is the true world champion ! that s true , isn t it ? it looked as if you had an especially difficult battle in the final match against no"
"actually , if i d wanted to defeat her , five seconds would have been plenty"
"my opponent being a girl , and all but it would have been inexcusable to my many fans , who came to see my strength , if i d ended it so readily"
"if i were to be controlled by him kakarrot , the gap between us might be closed the result was just as i thought"
"i won t allow the revival ! ! a kamehame ha of resistance dabura , he s emerging now ! majin boo is emerging ! y yes ! the seal has finally been broken ! we will finally be able to see majin boo ! so , come on out ! what sort of incredible guy is majin boo , who my papa created ! ? we are indeed certainly looking forward to this , babidi sama ! i ve been eagerly awaiting this day ! hurry and come on out ! f father s damage energy having gone beyond super saiyan , father s damage energy who could have thought it would have revived majin boo so quickly ? it s no longer any use ! let s run away , gohan san ! let s run away , gohan san ! if we do such a thing , then what ? is it okay for us to leave it here like this ? if we do that , majin boo will be revived ! there is no way we can win against majin boo , gohan san ! no matter how strong you guys may be , it s impossible ! the person who can defeat majin boo does not exist in this world ! if we stay here , make no mistake , we will be killed ! but kaioshin sama hurry , gohan san ! let s run away ! kaioshin sama ! hurry ! ! as long as he s already at full power , i can at least gohan san , what are you ? w what is he planning to do ? a good question"
"something more frightfully terrible than anything else up to now i it can t be ! goten chan s run off somewhere now , and just when i m thinkin gohan and goku sa have appeared , they go vanishin again"
"what am i supposed to do ? why , that lousy babidi sama ! i will go and make him heed us ! i it s all right ! majin boo won t even blink over something like this ! y you fool ! doing such a thing is worthless ! all right ! out he comes ! majin boo ! babidi sama ! it s empty ! n no ! this wasn t supposed to be ! it can t be ! why is this ? why is this so ? come on out ! come on out , i say ! majin boo ! please , come out ! what good fortune ! tough luck , babidi ! majin boo was exterminated by that attack just now ! it s probable he shriveled up over his long sleep , and no matter how much energy you poured into him , he would not be as tough as he was in the past ! and now , the earth will be saved ! it is well , is it not , babidi sama ? even if we do not have majin boo , i am here"
"gohan san , if you will then defeat dabura , babidi s ambitious schemes will utterly evaporate ! and so , as you were told by goku san , now is just the time for you to become angry ! become angry , and show your true power for me ! gohan san , peace has nearly come upon us ! t t that s not true ! a terrible ki a terrible ki is swelling up ! i it s w what is it you re saying , gohan san ? the smoke ! the smoke that came out of where that ball is ! what ? what is he looking at ? that cloud ! no , the smoke from before is gathering ! y you don t mean ! not bad , vegeta ! i ll show you what i do best ! what a terrible ki ! hey , up there ! c can it be ? babidi sama , is that majin boo ? n not sure"
"i is that true , gohan san ! ? yes ! if i can just put forward all of my force majin boo ! majin boo ! damn you ! wait , vegeta ! wait ! a ki ! an fairly enormous ki has appeared ! majin boo has emerged after all ! at last , majin boo is revived"
"a straight line to despair ! ? the grief of kaioshin wait , vegeta ! a ki ! an enormous ki has appeared ! he has emerged after all ! majin boo ! majin boo , huh ? here i was wondering how incredible a brute he was , and then he has this sort of battle power rating ? i thought it would be something like this ! listen , kakarrot ! we have now become overly strong ! altogether extraordinarily so ! have you even once thought that kaioshin , who all else aside should be this incredible guy , was impressive ? just the opposite , kaioshin has been the one who was surprised by our power , right ? in other words , i m saying that kaioshin may see majin boo as a fearsome enemy , but from where we stand , he s not all that formidable a guy"
"there s something different than usual about this ki ! stop fretting around ! if you re trying to get out of this fight , you re not going to ! vegeta ! you have to have realized it as well ! hey , majin boo ! i i m babidi , the child of bibidi , who created you ! i ve revived you after you were sealed up in your ball for an incredibly long time ! a and so , starting today , i will be your master ! hey ! what s the matter ? answer me ! you ll at least answer me ! i am your master ! hey , majin boo ! hey , there ! w what s the matter , majin boo ? he s a mere buffoon ! what is it he might be doing ? w why you ! i do not know why , but it appears his revival was unsuccessful"
"if we all work together , i m sure we can beat majin boo ! not even you could help having been caught off guard"
settling up with you will come afterward if i m still alive
"incredible ! you re incredible ! now , majin boo , do as i tell you ! i am you new master ! you defy me ? a are you sure it s okay to disobey me ? i ve seen my papa s notes , and i know something the spell to seal you up in your ball ! you don t want to go back in there , do you ? all right ! that will do ! that will do ! kaioshin sama , isn t majin boo still something like a child ? if we defeat babidi there , would he perhaps not do such maniacal things ? t that won t do ! if babidi is gone , then it will become impossible to seal up majin boo again ! despite how he appears , majin boo is really a terrible monster ! before long , he will grow beyond babidi s control , and then , the time when he is sealed up again is sure to come ! until that time , all we can do is patiently sit tight"
"i was sure i would be able to defeat babidi and halt majin boo s revival ! i if i knew it was to be like this if i had known that there were those such as you , who even while being human , had power which so greatly surpassed my own and despite having that other method ! other method ? no , it s too late"
"what are you saying ! ? if it s just escaping , we can manage something or other ! all right ! okay , majin boo , this is your first command"
"the terrifying majin ! ! death s dread draws near gohan great ! great , majin boo ! get him ! get him ! get him good ! gohan san t this can t be ! kaioshin sama ! outstanding , majin boo ! kill him ! kill him ! k kaioshin sama o okay then how about that ! ? what ! ? yow ! oh , my ! have you come all the way back here ? well , well now ! oh , really ? does it hurt , kaioshin ? yeah , this is quite the misfortune ! huh ! ? again ! ? what s wrong ? what s wrong ? are you taking a nap in a place such as this ? no one could think you re the one who stands at the top of the world ! it serves you right ! i know ! how about i strike the final blow ? are you all right , kaioshin sama ! ? damn , and just as it turning out well , too ! what kind of guy is this ? i had no effect on him at all ! you re in the way ! you get lost ! gohan san ! look out ! we can t see him any more ! fly away , to the ends of the universe ! p please , be a alive hey ! did you do something just now ! ? those guys those guys who the hell are they ? i won t have it ! i absolutely forbid you to keep company with this weakling boy ! ! i ve got to calm down ! come to mention it , how was videl , who isn t part of that group , able to fly through the air ? ha ! is that it ! ? it s so absurd , i d never even thought of it before , but maybe humans are naturally able to fly ! otherwise , there s no reason videl was able to ! ahem if those mysterious guys are able to so much as fly , then there s no reason the world s strongest martial combatant , mister satan , cannot ! that s not it , huh ? in that case ! um , we re with the mister satan fan club this was nothing , here ! see , i was just developing a new finishing attack , is all you had this coming to you , kaioshin ! you ve quite thoroughly been an encumbrance , but i am thankful to you ! after all , thanks to the people you brought with you , majin boo was able to be revived ! this is the least i could do to show my feelings of gratitude"
we ll be found out if they sense us ! yeah ! huh ? we don t know any of these guys ! that s not so ! look ! the one who s down over there
"gonna eat cha ! ! a hungry majin s supernatural power if i break this cover and go through , i ll be in babidi s spaceship"
i should be able to reach majin boo s location quickly if i demolish the spaceship
"y you ve gotta be kidding me ! t this terrible ki belongs to him , right ! ? i know ! majin boo ! him too ! eat up kaioshin too ! is that kaioshin sama ! ? hey , stop , piccolo ! if you go out there , what do you plan on doing ! ? be patient ! i know how you feel , but you have to be patient ! frankly , he s an opponent not even you can match up against ! that s for sure ! he was stabbed through with a spear , but it was no big deal to him ! and he turns his opponents into candy and eats them ! what am i gonna turn you into to eat ? maybe choco ? maybe jelly drops ? what a tragic end , for someone such as yourself ! w what ! ? what ! ? what ! ? m my spaceship ! ! i it can t be ! dammit , dammit , dammit ! what s the meaning of this ! ? hey , majin boo , do you know who did such an awful thing ? is someone there ? y you re ! yo ! it s papa ! vegeta ? vegeta , what are you doing here ? vegeta san y you don t mean , you re the one who destroyed my spaceship ! ? yeah"
"a warrior s resolution ! ! i will dispose of the majin v vegeta w what s the matter ? what is majin boo doing ? a awesome ! vegeta is unbelievably strong ! way to go ! way to go , papa ! you re incredible ! give him some more ! way to go ! way to go ! give him more ! him as well vegeta has also surpassed even super saiyan such inordinate power as when gohan fought against cell no , even greater ! h however , that same gohan was himself done in by majin boo ! so long as we don t know the whereabouts of goku , if this current vegeta is ineffective , there s no one in the world that can stand against majin boo ! vegeta , the fate of the earth no , the entire universe rests on your shoulders ! m majin boo ! impossible ! there s no way my majin boo can lose ! awesome ! he got him ! he got him ! he got him ! he got him ! he got him ! that s my papa for you ! uh huh ! did you see that , goten , my papa s strength ? yeah ! uncle is incredible ! of course he is ! after all , he s my papa ! what ? great ! great ! majin boo , this time it s our turn ! kill vegeta ! papa ! go ! he did it ! he did it ! he did it ! it s true ! that was amazing ! i it can t be ! majin boo my majin boo ! he did it ! that hurt a bit"
"thank goodness , huh , lizard san ! kaioshin sama ! ! papa ! ! d damn it all ! hmph ! how can this be ! ? y you re strong , on top of which , you re immortal it s ridiculous ! dirty bastard ! you re a tough one ! to think you re still alive ! if only you hadn t defied me , you could have been such a good servant ! what a shame ! papa even vegeta is utterly no match for him gohan is dead , and even kaioshin , the legitimate ruler over all the world , has been vaporized"
"bye bye ! bye bye ! w what do i do ? what the hell can i do to beat this monster ! ? you re one creepy punk ! what are you thinking of doing ? don t you toy with me ! hmph ! i could handle that scale of attack with my eyes closed ! what ! ? this is bad ! oh boy , oh boy ! oh boy , oh boy ! he ll be killed ! what the hell happened to goku and gohan ! ? a are they already dead ? y you think my big brother would die ! ? k keep it under control , trunks ! even if you were to go , there s nothing you could do ! you d just die for no reason ! you d only be hurting vegeta all the more ! no way ! ! trunks kun ! trunks has sprung forward in order to save a critical vegeta ! however , the menace posed by majin boo is surely closing in on the warriors"
"for those whom he loves vegeta perishes ! ! wait ! trunks ! trunks kun ! i m going too ! goten ! stop ! it ll be the same if you go ! don t do anything futile ! but uncle and trunks kun ! if my big brother were here , he d definitely go ! goten ! ah , dammit ! what ! ? w what was that just now ? uncle ! papa ! papa ! who are those pipsqueaks ? did he still have some companions around ? well , it s all the same , no matter how many of those guys there are ! papa ! are you okay , uncle ! ? shake it off , papa ! papa ! papa ! papa ! papa ! papa ! is he dead ? don t say such a stupid thing ! there s no reason papa would die from just this , you know ! b but , it s impossible for him to fight anymore ! get this , goten ! pick out your ears and listen well ! i heard this from my mama"
"papa is get this the proud saiyan prince ! a prince ! ? that s right ! my papa is incredible ! you think the saiyan prince would be beaten by the likes of that guy ! ? ah , papa ! uncle ! t trunks what happened to him ! ? still alive , are you ? it would have been so much easier for you if you had just died and gotten it over with"
"what ! ? i want you to stop your nonsense ! majin boo may be too much , but i ll bet i could kill you ! barrier ! how about that ! ? i can manage a little bit too , you know ! papparapa ! majin boo ! boo ! majin boo ! what are you doing ! ? this one ! kill this one ! are you sure you re able to kill me ? f fool ! if you kill me , majin boo can never be sealed up again ! i if that happens , majin boo will destroy the whole universe until there s nothing left ! is that okay with you ! ? the same holds true even if you aren t dead ! am i wrong ! ? die ! this can t be ! i was going to be king of the world ! who did it ! ! ? who made this happen to me ! ? trunks , take good care of bulma your mama w what do you mean by that , papa ? take care of your mama ? you guys go take shelter somewhere , far away"
"i fight alone against majin boo ! u uncle ? no way ! we re going to fight too ! papa , you ll be killed fighting alone ! if the three of us fight , we re sure to defeat him ! right , goten ! ? yeah ! we re strong , you know ! no chance"
"no matter how many of us were to attack him in the usual manner of fighting , anyhow uncle ! if the three of us fight , it ll be easy , easy ! this isn t like you , papa ! getting all pessimistic ! yeah ! right , right ! uncle , you have to always act like a big shot ! yeah ! trunks , from the time you were a baby , i ve never once given you a hug , have i ? let me hug you"
"the nightmare revisited ! ! majin boo has survived v vegeta ! vegeta ! vegeta ! piccolo ! it s too late ! that s the mark of vegeta s life burning out ! you said it yourself , didn t you ? that vegeta is laying down his life , and for the first time , fighting for someone else ? videl san , you re sure that gohan and goten went off to where these horrible madoshi and majin boo guys you were talkin about are , right ? yes"
yup ! he wasn t normal ! i wonder if he s returned to being the vegeta he was when he first came to earth
"vegeta you ve sacrificed your very self for the first time , you fought for someone else , and died"
"where s the last one at ? let s see can we really bring everyone back to life with these balls ? if we appeal to shen long , he will grant us any three wishes"
"land there ! okay ! yamucha ! can t you land any better than that ! ? sorry , sorry ! this wasn t a very good place for it ! old man ! what are you doing ! ? this wasn t my fault ! i just automatically slanted this way ! if you want to complain , talk to yamucha ! pafu pafu pafu ! just like a real human ! ah ! my neck ! why , you dirty old man ! oh , please , no ! i m gonna be crushed ! but that was the tops ! the tops ! things re gettin terrible again , huh ? yeah"
"piccolo san , what s going to happen to the earth now ? if you , the kami over the earth can t tell , there s no reason i should be able to ! sorry even kaioshin sama had this much difficulty against this enemy"
can t fight if hungry
"you know that , don t you ? this is no time to be saying that , already ! chichi san , please ? all right ! videl san ! you re gonna be gohan s bride ! don t go gettin hurt ! we re counting on this , four star ball ! me too ! flashy trunks be damned ! if i don t go now , i m not a man ! see here , videl san s gonna be gohan s bride ! keep your paws off ! cut it out ! don t embarrass me any further ! i ve got a cold ! a cold ! here you go ! good luck , there ! ah ! muten roshi sama ! pee yew ! let s get over our colds quickly ! turtle hermit , thanks"
"say , dende or rather , kami sama , would it be okay if i brought everyone in my family here ? i guess that would be wrong , huh ? us only choosing to save our own folks"
"what happened yourself ! ? you re pretty banged up ! i will heal you , goku san ! yeah , dende , if you would ! piccolo , now that goku has come , our hopes for fighting majin boo have just gotten greater , haven t they ? goku s heavily damaged body is healed through dende s mysterious power"
"if memory serves , that was the midpoint of the serpentine road"
"if we leave him alone like this , then there s really no mistaking it never mind earthlings , every living being in the universe will be wiped out"
"so that s it ? not even goku can help , huh ? i guess not damn ! if either vegeta or gohan had survived , there might still be something we could do no , no matter how many of us gang up , it probably would do no good"
what kind of technique is it ? it s a unification technique that can be used only if the powers and body sizes of two people are pretty close
"if either vegeta or gohan were alive , you could have done this fusion , become some extraordinary warrior , and fought against majin boo , right ! ? yeah"
"goku cannot come to this world once more , even if he were to accomplish fusion"
"piccolo , even if they are exterminated , as long as you guys have the dragonballs , you can return things to normal"
"what ? it s suddenly gotten dark ! i it s ! shen long is coming out ? w why ! ? bulma san is the one who gathered the dragonballs , right ? she must not know the situation yet ! why would she call up shen long ? that s it ! vegeta killed a bunch of people at the tournament grounds ! she s trying to bring them back to life ! t this is bad ! if all three wishes get granted , it will be another year before any more wishes are possible ! okay , i ll go right away and stop them"
"if there s only been one , then we can use him again in four months"
"w what are you saying ? surely seeking shelter for yourselves is more important than your pets right now ! right , mama ? bulma , if mama is killed by this majin boo , you can just bring us back to life with the dragonballs"
"y you can t be son kun ? bulma , if the worst happens , you have to search for the dragonballs"
"ah , wait a minute ! majin boo ! w what are you doing ! ? let me go ! how ill mannered of you ! you re the ill mannered one here , aren t you uncle ? uncle ! ? please pay for those cakes ! include the cost for repairs to the door , the show window , and everything else , if you please ! i won t let you go until then"
"whether or not this world continues on its way to destruction is entirely up to my will ! i am madoshi babidi sama ! i don t care if you re a madoshi or a keiyoshi adjective , you ll have to pay your bill ! how rude of you ! papparapa ! she vanished ! would you like to try vanishing too ! ? help me ! attention criminals ! cease your futile resistance and come out quietly ! majin boo ! haven t you had enough yet ! ? no good"
they said if they do get killed we can just bring them back to life with the dragonballs
"if only we knew where tenshinhan and them are , we could let them take shelter here too"
"come on out ! you must know who you are yourselves ! if you don t come out i know , why don t we introduce ourselves ? i am the terrifying madoshi babidi sama ! and this is my servant , the even more frightening majin boo ! he s a strong one ! there is utterly no one around who can beat him ! can you see this city ? if those three fools do not come forward , let me show you just a little of what will happen"
"gohan revived kaioshin s secret weapon ! ? if those three don t come forward , everyone is going to be eaten up ! and now , there s no reason to have this city here with no people left in it , right ? i have no choice but to sweep it up for you ! okay , majin boo , make it clean ! not too hard , though , or the whole earth will be wiped out ! okay ! okay ! that guy s getting cocky now ! my , my , my , looks like he messed it up instead ! i ll say it one more time"
"and so , i think it would be best if you tell me soon"
"of course , contact from those people themselves is most welcome ! i m sure those three were hey ! if he doesn t find them fast , we re all going to be turned to candy and eaten ! doesn t anyone know them ! ? i don t know who you are , but where are you hiding ! ? come out now ! we re going to be turned into candy and eaten because of you ! if i am turned into candy here and eaten now , then all the studying i ve done for my entrance exams will have meant that i did it all for nothing , you stupid jerks ! ! we were to have our wedding tomorrow"
"what sort of foolishness are you saying , piccolo ! ? if you die , who will there be to teach fusion to trunks and goten in place of me ! ? if they can t perform fusion , majin boo cannot be beaten ! in any event , they are going to destroy earth"
"h huh ? kaioshin sama where is this ? the kaioshin realm , or if you like , my world"
these children could be awesome if do fusion
"pull it out ? seems like there was something like this in ancient folklore y you re lying ! papa beaten by that guy ! ? it s a lie ! a lie ! a lie ! big brother is dead ! stop crying ! there ain t any time for it ! if you don t like it , then hurry and learn this new technique and avenge them ! got it ! ? i know it seems harsh , but babidi might find out about this place sometime"
"hey , hey , hey ! everyone has already decided they re dead , even though we haven t even found any bodies ! how come ! ? it s strange that you should know that gohan kun has died ! look , we know how you feel , but seeing as how we feel absolutely no ki from him it must be that gohan is no longer of this world i don t believe it i won t believe it ! i absolutely won t believe such a thing ! gohan kun all right ! um , kaioshin sama , what happens if i pull out this , er , z sword ? it is said that you will obtain tremendous power"
r right now i don t feel as if i ve gotten any incredible power is that so ? i wonder if i can really use this to defeat majin boo
"what are you saying ! ? the z sword is the mightiest blade ever to come to this holy region ! it can surely defeat majin boo ! of course , that might be impossible if its bearer wields it so unsteadily"
"even if your fusion succeeds and you join together , you can only stay that way for thirty minutes"
"i think that , knowing these two , if they can just do the fusion , they ll definitely defeat majin boo"
"but even if i am a coward , i can still teach you this fusion technique"
"if you really want to avenge vegeta and gohan , this is the only way"
"besides which , you should be training ! do not think about anything else , and focus your mind ! right ! humans unmistakably can fly , our bodies have just forgotten how to use the power that allows us to"
"fusion , huh ? if it were me and goku kuririn , that s too big ! match up with goku ! goku ! hurry and become more like me ! well , who s to say that wouldn t have happened ? that s right ! the only one left that can protect the earth is me , satan ! i don t mean saving little fish , and i don t mean saving big fish ! i m here to save the earth , where all of you live ! you ll see , i will surely save us from the hands of majin boo ! ! this i now swear to you ! way to go , satan ! we re counting on you ! good luck ! and now , ladies and gentlemen , i now return to my harsh , bitter training ! however , i will endure any training , no matter how harsh ! and so , briefly , until we meet again , ladies and gentlemen , farewell ! satan ! satan ! satan ! that went over so well it scares me"
"but you know , if majin boo were to come while i m in the middle of training , i m screwed"
"i ll get him ! satan ! satan ! satan ! the terrible majin boo threatens to destroy the earth ! and yet , where are ma junior , trunks , and son goten , whom majin boo and babidi seek , and what are they doing ? this isn t any laughing matter ! if they don t show themselves quickly , it ll mean trouble for us ! trunks ? trunks ! knock a hole in his dumb looking face right away ! it couldn t be ! not that hateful little brat ! i don t want to die over that brat ! i have to hurry and tell where he lives ! mama , i m sure his house is in metro west ! really ? yep"
"son kun , it really will be bad if metro west is destroyed ! the dragon radar will also be lost ! that is a problem"
"w will you be all right ? uncle , can you delay them ? won t you get beaten right away ? well , if it s just for a little while , i can manage something"
"never mind me , hurry ! or else they ll reach metro west first ! trunks , be careful ! if it gets dangerous , come right back here ! okay ! trunks kun , good luck ! got it ! is everything really going to be all right ? oh well"
"what s wrong with you ? you re that strong , yet you re still under babidi s thumb ? majin boo ! quiet , you ! don t go saying anything funny ! majin boo is my servant ! of course he listens to what i tell him to do ! w what ? do you want me to use the spell and seal you up again ? if you seal me up , you re gonna be killed by him ! w why you , when did you come by such uncalled for wisdom ? but i ll kill him for you"
i wonder if trunks has reached the capsule corporation yet
"is he just standing there ? hurry it up , already ! if possible , i didn t want to take my form even beyond super saiyan this is goten s father s ki ! ? it s an incredible ki ! besides that , all of a sudden , he s traveled way past me ! is this that instantaneous movement technique ? do you hear me ! ? come on ! ! go get the radar now ! ! r right ! w what ? who the hell are you talking to ? what radar ? nothing at all"
"just insignificant transformations ! no great change between them , is there ? and then from a super saiyan that has gone beyond super saiyan , h he s going beyond even farther ? y you re just bluffing , right goku ? to think there s something even higher ! this g goku is going even further beyond super saiyan ! s stop , goku ! i if you do that , your remaining time will disappear ! your time is limited ! i incredible ! his ki is swelling up more and more ! father ! w what is this ! ? awesome ! it s even bigger than it was earlier ! ah , i shouldn t be doing this ! i have to hurry ! stop ! stop it , goku ! attacking the earth t the entire earth is shaking ! i is this goku s power ? even with us so far away ? w w what s happening ! ? this is super saiyan ! sorry it took so much time"
"leave it at that ! if you keep using that extraordinary power , your time on earth will be drastically reduced ! you have to teach fusion to the little ones ! for a goody goody , you re pretty strong"
"there s no time for that ! if we don t hurry , metro west will be destroyed ! if we lose the dragon radar , we won t be able to return all the dead people back to normal ! my , that is a problem"
"sorry ! after all of us went searching for the dragonballs earlier , i left it inside the airplane ! d does trunks know about that ? he couldn t ! then he must be figuring to look in all the wrong places , right ? come to mention it , he is taking a while we have to get in touch with trunks right away ! kuririn , a telephone ! a telephone ! easy for you to say , but there aren t any phones here ! um , if it s a phone you need , i have one here"
"all right ! with this , we can contact trunks ! oh , videl , nicely done ! you go away ! you got him ! you got him ! goku ! that s quite enough ! hurry and stop the fight ! if you use any more energy than this , the time you can be on earth will be gone ! this guy is much stronger than i had thought ! ah , bulma ? how are you ? is everyone doing fine ? fine ! fine ! can you put trunks on ? trunks ? just a moment"
"okay , here goes again ! w wha what the ! ? boo ! majin boo ! majin boo ! banzai ! don t tell me he s doing a kamehame ha ! dammit ! a all the way here , at this temple ! incredible it s an incredible fight ! we re this far apart , and yet i can tell what s happening as if it were within my grasp ! gohan san , it would be difficult for goku san to win this after all"
"even if metro west is destroyed , as long as we have the dragon radar , we can turn it back to the way it was"
"it could be that majin boo will now stand down quietly then , that means that peace will return to earth , right ! ? i wonder it would be nice if that were so , but so , don t do anything , just wait ! stop killing people for no reason ! two days"
"damn ! if that rat felt like it , he could wipe out the whole earth in an instant , everything here included ! it ll be all right ! he ain t going to destroy the whole earth at once , i don t think"
"even if just a little bit even if just a little bit , i have to become more like father ! majin boo is still alive , after all ! goku , there s something i want to ask now , while i can"
"what s that ? with that super saiyan if you had gone all out , you could have defeated boo , couldn t you have ? how about it ? am i wrong ? eh"
"even if i were to defeat him , someone else outrageous will appear at some time , right ? it s a dangerous risk to take but looking at those two ultra prodigy squirts , i decided to try taking that risk"
"right ! right ! once you ve gotten your ki to be exactly the same , if the two of you can also perform the fusion pose together exactly the same , your fusion will be complete ! i m going to show you the pose , so you two learn it well ! got that ? yes ! yes ! first , you two will stand with a certain degree of space between you"
"got it ? okay , give it a try ! what s wrong ? what does symmetrical mean ? um , how can i explain ? all right ! me and piccolo will try doing it for you , so watch closely ! i will ! ? ready ? watch carefully ! like this , as if being reflected in a mirror both of you move opposite each other"
"fu sion ! ha ! ! w what this ? they said they were training , but is this dance training ? are they really going to be able to defeat majin boo like that ? all right ! trunks ! goten ! you do it ! right ! goku , you said you wanted to try doing this together with vegeta but , even if he were still alive , i don t think he would have done this with you"
"goku , take care may sound a little strange , but take care , okay ? yeah ! goku sa ! yow ow ow ! g goku sa , what am i supposed to do ? gohan s gone and all chichi , don t get all depressed like that ! you ve got goten , don t you ? b but , what if he gets killed by majin boo ? don t worry"
"if they can master this technique they re doing , there ain t no way they ll lose ! once i see gohan on the other side , i ll tell him you said hello"
"still , it d be nice if he was alive , huh ? yes well , that s it"
"where is gohan ! ? ferocious training in the kaioshin realm wow , the number of dead is incredible ! so , are you sure you were right leaving the earth up to those little guys ? yeah ! knowing them , it ll be okay ! if they can just master fusion , they ll defeat majin boo for sure"
"he would have just been thrilled if i sent him to hell , heaven so i sent him to heaven instead ! that s great ! thank you , yama san ! yahoo ! gohan is alive ! it s just like that girl videl said ! he came out safely against majin boo ! not too bad , gohan ! you know something , seeing as how we didn t feel gohan s ki at all , what does that mean ? t that s gohan it is ! unmistakable ! that s gohan s ki ! but why would gohan s ki be in a place like this ? huh ? where is it ? it ain t in here , nor in the kaio realm"
"all right ! you re right ! this is incredibly heavy ! you see ? and this will give you fantastic power ? awesome ! i impossible ! this man is also just swinging the z sword around easily ! ? what sort of people are these saiyans ! ? say , kaioshin sama , do you suppose it would be okay if i stayed here until gohan goes to fight majin boo ? sure , i do not mind"
"after all , we ve only had it properly shown to us one time so far ! that s right , that s right ! if we don t have an accurate example shown to us , we can t learn it ! okay ? kuririn , give me a hand ! m me ! ? you saw that much yesterday"
"t that may be true , but why me ? everyone else here saw that pose too ! that s a dirty trick ! huh ? hey ! where are you ? kuririn ! all right ! i ll do it ! i just have to do it , right ? ready ? watch closely ! right ! a as i remember , it was like this , right ? here goes , kuririn ! y yeah fu sion ! ha ! ! w we re doing that ridiculous looking thing ! ? it s embarrassing ! i m embarrassed too , you know ! w we re doing this because you guys said you wanted to see it , didn t you ? come on ! quit griping , and let s start training again ! okay can you believe this ? two thirds of the earth s urban population has already been eradicated by majin boo ! at this rate the earth will become a dead planet in less than a day ! w what ! ? next ! not even one of you gets away ! good day ! who s there ? can t you tell by looking ? i m i m sorry"
open them up ! i can t see even if they are open ! that s what kind of disease it is
"all right ! what have you done ? dummy ! try opening your eyes ! but , even if i open them just open them ! i can see i can see ! i can see"
"yeah , but goten s being too slow ! am not ! trunks kun is too fast ! what was that ! ? oh , yeah ! ? enough already ! we don t have any time for this ! if you want to fight , you can do it all you like , after you defeat majin boo ! all right"
"all right , here goes , gohan ! try cutting this clean in half ! i m sure it will cut right through it like tofu ! if i know the z sword here ! you did it , gohan san ! yes wow ! that s awfully sharp ! goku san let s try something even harder this time"
"see ? perhaps it meant that if you came to be able to use that sword , you would have the greatest power in the world , maybe"
"t that s it ! if you ve gotten that much power in your regular state , once you turn super saiyan , you should experience a considerable power up ! that s it ! that s the legendary greatest power in the world ! but whether that power is greater than majin boo s i don t know b but goku san , there isn t any other way"
"if this keeps up , i fear we will find it hard not to get in line ourselves"
"if that s the case , i ll give you a dirty book next time i see you , so tell us ! f father ! goku san ! how could you say that ! ? hmph ! i don t have to see any book ! with my godly eyes , i can see gals bathing and change their clothes and stuff just fine , you know ! h honorable forefather ! well , in a little while , i ll let you touch a real woman s boobs and behind ! r really ! ? yeah ! sure thing ! that s got him ! i knew it , he s the same type as old man turtle hermit ! father , when you say that , what do you intend to do ? what will i do ? since i can t go down to the lower realm any more you ve got a girlfriend , right , that girl videl ? i hate to ask , but for just a bit , have her let him touch her"
"and that s the game ! ta da ! say , would it be okay if she s kind of a middle aged woman ? well , if she s sexy , i suppose that would be fine"
"see ? just by allowing him to touch someone s behind and boobs , the earth no , the whole universe can be saved ! isn t that sexual harassment ? and besides , i m the one who has to ask her , right ? even if the universe does get saved , i m going to get killed by bulma san ! fine ! okay ! it s settled then"
"ever heard of such an incredible ability ? hey , that s an ability you hear about rather often , ain t it ? what are you talking about ! ? past their limits , you know , past their limits ! there s absolutely no one else like that ! n now that you mention it , i guess not"
"if anyone was able to pull that sword out and be able to swing it around , y know , once i set him up , y know , he s sure to be the strongest in the universe"
"birth of a superhuman warrior ! ! his name is gotenks fusion ! fusion ! hey ! hey everyone , i heard the pee wees are about to try out their fusion ! then the special training is finally over ? let s go see ! you re going ? upon merging , they re supposed to have an enormous ki , and there d be trouble if the palace were damaged , so they said they re doing it out front"
"just think if they became some predisposed macho man ! their name what ll happen to their name , once they re done mergin ? they re goten and trunks , so gotenks ? or will it be trunten ? naw , either way , it s a deranged name , huh ? what are you saying ? they ll only be merged for around thirty minutes , so a name doesn t matter , does it ? but , won t we have trouble tryin to call him ? they re doing it , they re doing it ! trunks , hold your ki down just a bit more"
"in that case , give me thirty minutes and i ll defeat him and return in time to give back plenty of change ! what speed ! y you miserable fool ! if you get killed now , everything will have been wiped out ! h he was sure an overbearing fellow , but you never know , he may just be able to defeat majin boo ! yeah ! he really did seem sure of himself , huh ? are you awakening , goku san ? kaioshin sama how s gohan ? has his power up been finished yet ? good grief ! it has only been two hours"
"the final weapon is engaged ! ? satan will save the earth just as if he were a little child , majin boo seems to enjoy killing those who oppose him or , of course , run away from him"
"if you would please , be careful ! looks like everyone knows it"
"if you move , i can t swab this on , you know ! that hurts ! what are you talkin about ! ? you brought this on yourself ! listen , goten , you re all i ve got left"
"r right that s right ! you are the last hope the earth here has ! learn your lesson from this , and refrain from doing anything else so rash ! piccolo san ? what is it ? my papa was awfully strong , right ? do you think i can surpass my papa ? i want to defend the earth , here , the same way my papa tried to defend it ! and so , for that reason as well , i have to become even stronger than my papa ! trunks ! within your two bodies within your two bodies flows the same warrior blood that has come to create possibility from impossibility many times over"
"very well , if you please please defend the peace of this world for us ! u um , mister satan ? what s in the bag ? this ? let s just say this is a secret weapon to defeat majin boo , just in case"
"prepare yourself ! i m going to give it to you out and out , through and through , and over and over ! u um , mister satan ? have you strained your throat or something ? he can t hear you with that soft a voice ! ahem , yeah , um , you see , it s like this i know ! in that case , how about i say it for you ? hey , hey , majin boo ! why don t you get out here ! ? you re finished now ! you idiot ! if you speak in that loud a voice , he can hear you , you know ! apparently , he didn t notice"
"really ! you guys being here is just holding me back ! go back , go back ! well then , if you ll excuse us"
"be careful ! please take care of the earth ! tell the press corps for me that i , mister satan , will protect the peace ! well , now that those annoyances are gone i i wonder if majin boo is home"
"maybe he s not home he s not here ! did you get scared off by me , majin boo ! ? there s nothing i can do , huh ? after all , if he s not here , there s no way i can fight him ! that s all there is to it ! i ll go home ! nothing i can do but go home , huh ! ? you idiot ! you tubby ! a fart goes boo , pun intended ! i i i m so sorry , majin boo sama ! everything i said just now was untrue ! untrue ! actually , i respect you , boo sama , from the bottom of my heart ! why , you ! startle me , will you ! ? you ! you ! you ! do you think that someone as i would be anxious about majin boo ! ? yoo hoo ! yoo hoo ! w w why it s majin boo sama ! good day to you ! i m so pleased to meet you"
"most certainly ! what ? is someone there ? i uh i thought for a moment i saw what looked like somebody well , let s kill em ! s splendid ! great that was great ! great ! er , if it is all right with you , could you let me take a picture together with you ? please , as a memento"
"this time , even if your fusion is successful , do not get carried away ! you know majin boo s strength now , right ? we know ! all right"
"if we don t hurry and get away from the city and someplace within the mountains , we ll be found by majin boo ! i wonder if our grandchildren in the city got away safely"
"g grandma ! what s the matter ! ? hey ! yea ! i hit her in one shot ! t this still isn t right , young master ! you fool , does that concern me ? the whole world s people are being killed by majin boo ! just suppose majin boo was the one who killed them ! i ve always wanted to try shooting humans ! it s the greatest ! i ll let you shoot the old geezer ! go on , do it ! that s an order ! right hey , not too bad , was it ? see ? feels great , right ? let s go on killing away like that ! yes , that wasn t bad ! yahoo ! the city ! if we go to the city , there will be plenty of scumbags who have still survived ! you re so slow ! have you finally arrived ? i went around the earth many times over , and even took a short nap ! go flying off on your own , will you ? i ve been looking for you ! you can tell simply from my speed just now , can t you ? what wildly incredible power i have ? you sure do"
"however which means , our test is over ! w wait ! i ve decided to put him away right now , that annoying majin boo ! hey ! you fool ! what an impossible jackass ! you can only stay merged for another minute , you numbskull ! lousy majin boo ! this isn t going to go the same way it did last time ! you re going to be sorry you ever came across me ! yea ! yo , yo , yo ! majin boo ! it s me ! show your face ! who s there ! ? who s talking bad about me ! ? hey ! ! there , you see ? it s just your imagination ! is there anyone that would say anything like yo , yo to you ? as if he were snuggling up to nello , patrasche died as well"
"really ? your stuff is yummy , so i look forward to it ! of course ! be expecting some top notch delicious cooking , if you please ! well , i m off ! see you back later ! good luck ! stupid bastard ! don t get too carried away with yourself ! laugh it up now , while you still can ! with as much dynamite as this , no matter if he is majin boo , he ll be blown to bits ! there s enough destructive power here to blow up a tank , in any case ! i just have to push this remote control switch , and it s the end ! i will have been the one who saves the earth ! i ll just hide it in here ! hurry on back here , majin boo ! yahoo ! ! die ! die ! ! ! ! how do you like that ! ? but still , young master , if majin boo were to come here now , we d be in trouble ! they say that near here he has built himself a house ! you fool ! if that guy were to come here , it s no big deal ! i ve got a powerful bazooka here ! i am a hero after all ! h he s back here already ! i i deeply apologize ! i i am still in the middle of making your meal ! hey , here"
"a and who are they ? those unpleasant guys that made me ! y you mustn t listen to those disagreeable guys ! i it won t do to have you killing and destroying and so on ! n no , that s fine ! that s all fine , if you find it to be fun ! i i am so sorry ! you think it s wrong for me to do so ? y yeah , well okay , i ll stop ! y you re not going to kill anyone any more ? mm hmm"
y you re not going to destroy anywhere else ? mm hmm
"run away , satan ! ! an angry majin boo emerges w who did this ? that s one down ! w what are those imbeciles doing ! ? we didn t need this ! oh ? y young master ! that guy over there together with majin boo , isn t that mister satan ? why would the hero mister satan be together with majin boo ? hmph ! is that any concern of mine ? i ll just blow them both away at once ! we will become new heroes , in place of satan ! burn in hell ! take that ! i blew them to pieces ! you sure did it , young master ! this is the birth of a new hero , who saved the earth from majin boo ! h hey ! h he s still standing ! he s not blown to bits ! he moved ! he s still alive ! d damn that guy ! w why you ! you re gonna pay ! ! you re gonna pay for this ! ! w what ! ? you stupid piece of crap jackass ! ! you re gonna ! you re gonna ! you re gonna ! get the hell out of here ! scum of the earth ! dammit , what a cruel thing to do m majin boo san ! he s still barely alive ! quickly ! quickly ! how about it ? can you heal him ? if he s not dead , i can heal him"
"how nice for you , huh ! ? okay , now , spread those legs ! one two ! one two ! one two ! one two ! right , one more time ! one two ! one two ! one two ! there now ! see you again next week ! i wonder if the earth is okay while we re here doing this you were just thinking if everything is okay while we re doing this , right ? i told you at the beginning , the power up requires hours"
"kaioshin sama , shouldn t you be concentrating harder ? i m no amateur at this ! if i couldn t concentrate while doing this little , i couldn t be a kaioshin ! well , how about it ? sure , she s a downright beauty"
"everyone here at least knows that after thirty minutes , you return to normal ! we don t have time right now for you to be doing anything uncalled for ! do not do anything else on your own ! shall i wash your back ? you get in with us ! it s all right for me to get in with you ? don t be so restrained"
"get in ! right ! very well then , if you ll pardon the intrusion s s sorry about that ! fun , huh ? y yes , and the water is just the right temperature"
"fun ! fun ! fun , huh ? y yes ! that bath was just right ! er , if it is all right with you , could you let me take a picture together with you ? please , as a memento"
"you saw the power we had during our fusion , right ! ? leave the destruction of boo to us ! don t get so full of yourself ! we must make your fusion even more impeccable ! your power is still not enough ! there s no time to be playing around ! if things continue , everyone will be done in by this new boo ! piccolo , what are you lordin it over on them so much for ! ? don t go bullyin goten around just because you figure goku sa is gone ! b bullying ? that s right ! who do you think you are ! ? goten and trunks are still children ! this is usually the time they d be takin their naps , you know ! if you keep up nothing but their special training like this , then when the time comes , they ll be all tired out and get beaten ! let them rest for a little while ! a all right"
"gimme ! he s come to fight trunks and goten ! he s gotta be kiddin ! who s gonna let somethin like that happen ! ? i m gonna go shoo that guy away ! w wait ! chichi , if you head on out there , he ain t the kind of foe you can do nothin about ! let me go ! let me go ! let me go , i tell you ! let me go ! pa , let go of me ! let me go ! chichi ! gimme the strong guy ! if i let goten and trunks fight now , there s absolutely no chance of them winning"
"tell those half pints that if they don t want to die while they re still little scamps , then to train for all they re worth in there"
"why is this happening ? kaioshin sama a aren t you done yet ? it s well past time we should be finished , isn t it ? oh , is it that time already ? yes , it is time we should be finished , huh ? hoo ! the fact that we aren t done yet means that you must have incredible dormant capacities ! would you please cut this out ! ? there s no way i m going to be able to beat majin boo with all this nonsense of yours w what was that ? that power that just seemed to boil up ? w was that me ? hurry up and sit down ! if you keep fooling around , we ll lose that much more time ! i i m sorry about that ! really , i am a awesome ! he really ain t any ordinary old geezer ! y yes ! he s the kaioshin from for what that s worth dormant capacities are really one s true power that s hidden away , right ? that s what i believe"
"m mother dammit dammit ! dammit dammit ! hold yourself back , goten ! do you want all of this to be for nothing ! ? damn you , majin boo ! how dare you ! goten listen ! we can bring your mother back to life with the dragon balls ! that is , if you and trunks defeat majin boo ! however , with your power now , that s not possible , so you have to train ! in the short remaining time , you have to desperately train ! got it ? l let s go do it , goten ! we ll train really well , and then we ll flatten majin boo ! okay ? a all right ! sure is hot in here ! i wonder if they have a cooler or anything"
"h hey ! is piccolo planning to let majin boo fight with goten and trunks inside the room of spirit and time ? why would he make them fight in the room of spirit and time ? i think it s because once they re inside the room of spirit and time , then even if trunks san and goten san were to lose or anything , you can destroy the entrance , and seal that world up inside"
"even if killed , it is possible to bring the two of them back to life with the dragon balls"
"if they had turned at the last corner , they would have been right there"
"if that s so , it s no problem ! we ll just become like we did just now , and given five minutes , we can beat him for sure ! dummy ! that won t be very exciting ! we ve trained for a whole week ! the way i m thinking , i figure that even in our regular fusion state , we ve improved to about the same level as majin boo"
"let s go again , goten ! right ! ready , set fu w what ! ? why aren t they starting this as super saiyans ! ? sion ha ! ! all right , good ! right from the start , they ve merged perfectly ! dum dum dum dumm ! it s gotenks ! you , huh ? i remember ! you re the guy i beat to a pulp before ! you stupid dirtbag ! you re badly mistaken if you think i m the same as i was before ! my time is limited ! i ll show you right away how i m different from how i was before ! h he certainly is different ! he certainly is greatly powered up ! c can this possibly mean ? can i attack you yet ? j just a moment , okay ? t this is strange"
"hang on there , you guys ! how can you say that so casually ? what if they lose to boo , and piccolo destroys the doorway ? neither trunks nor goten kun will ever come out of that room again ! t that s why , once we bring them back to life with the dragon balls so , are you saying to them that once they lose , they have to die ? is it okay for kami sama to say such a thing ! ? when a person dies , it s incredibly painful for us , you know ! senju kannon thousand armed goddess of mercy punch ! ! daikaiten great spinning kick ! ! i is that part of his plan as well ? is that what they call aesthetic ? that s enough ! you re weak ! this is no fun"
"i ve done it ! ! boo successfully eliminated with ghosts ! ? i m scary ! i m scary ! here goes ! i m ridiculously scary ! w what technique is that ! ? this is the first time i ve seen anything like that ! kaboom , he appears ! kaboom , it s a ghost ! this time , even you re dead , majin boo ! now , go ahead , ghost ! show him how dreadful the super ghost kamikaze attack is ! okay ! ready , set ! yea ! ! you fool ! if you touch a ghost even the slightest amount , you ll cause a huge explosion ! yea ! yea ! yahoo ! yahoo ! yahoo ! hurry up and finish him off ! he ll turn back to normal ! i know , i know , already ! i m going to finish this with one big hard blow ! super ghost kamikaze attack ! ! i m going to finish him with ten ghosts all at once ! all right ! fall in ! ten hut ! stand at arm s length ! you stupid jerk ! be more careful ! touch me and we ll explode , you know ! you shut up ! you re just too far forward ! see here , you two ! line up , and no more shigo talking ! what does shigo mean ? that s the place where us ghosts live ! no , that s the world shigo after death , you know ? it s a calculation , isn t it ? shi times go , ! quiet already , and just line up ! now , ten hut ! count off ! all right ! hey ! he s long since returned to normal majin boo"
"what is it with you ! ? how can you all be so calm ? bulma san , it s okay ! they re goku and vegeta s sons ! i m sure those two are going to save the world for us ! so then , numbers and will w what s up with this battle ? there s no sense of tension ! all right , here goes ! fight o ! ! okay ! let s give it to him ! serves him right ! dammit ! those jackasses ! those two stupid ghosts are gone , so everyone but number go on according to the plan ! go ! ! again ! ? oh ! what do you suppose this is ? what could it be ? that s strange ! what s it doing in a place like this ? it s you know one of those ! it s poop , isn t it ? dummy ! don t say that ! this sure is something nice , huh ? i wonder if it s yummy"
"i sure hope that kakarrot does come ! kuririn san dammit , what are you doing , goku ? has he really come back to life ? say , at this point , what if we ran away ? there s no way we can win"
"even if you run away now , you ll end up the same"
"if only i i had been more reliable earlier , tenshinhan san might not have had to die that s right ! who knew you were such a coward ! ? piccolo , be reasonable"
"w who s running away ! ? i just have to go pee ! and if you guys are going to go home , now is your chance"
"if they can buy even one minute one second of time to let goku come back , nothing could work to our advantage better"
i wonder if son kun will get back during this time
"on the other hand , if piccolo gets killed , kami sama dies too , right ? what happens to our world if that happens ! ? isn t it obvious ? either way , if son kun and the others don t defeat those saiyans all of us are going to be killed"
"goku ! get here quick and defeat them ! if i have to die anyway , i wish i could have collected more gals panties before i went"
"of course , that s only if everything goes well"
"escape from another dimension ! ! super gotenks majin boo , if you re going to kill us , then kill us"
"you ve got to be joking ! this is why i was against this ! b bulma san ! we do have the dragon balls , so even if they have died once , we can return them to that s not the issue , is it ! ? you re all cowards ! how can you have children fight against that bad guy , no matter how strong they are ! ? how can you leave the fate of the whole earth up to them ! ? you re all just cowards ! my candy ! my candy is gone ! hey ! piccolo san ! why did you do that without saying anything ! ? i still had a great technique held in reserve ! y you what ! ? you said something to the effect that you were at your limit , didn t you ! ? that was just a light joke ! one of those little white lies ! i absolutely , absolutely had a technique that was sure to stop majin boo ! and now now ! what are you , brainless ! ? there are no little lies at a time like this ! ! it s not even the slightest bit little ! stupid ! stupid ! stupid ! stupid ! you re the stupid one ! stupid ! stupid ! i want to go back to our prior world ! make the entranceway go back the way it was ! it s been blown apart ! how am i supposed to make it go back again ? stupid ! stupid ! stupid ! i want candy ! candy ! i can t stand this ! ! huh ? what s that ? piccolo san , what s that ? i it couldn t be ! i i don t believe it ! that s it ! with the fantastic power of his ki , majin boo has opened up a hole in the wall between dimensions ! this is bad ! he can escape ! the hole is disappearing ! i can t stand to be in this place ! he s escaping ! d dammit , no ! yow ! it s vanished ! what s that ? it s majin boo s ki ! looks as if he s finally come out of the room of spirit and time"
"if boo did it , there s no reason we can t do it too"
"but if i don t do something , who else is going to protect her ? no"
"if things go well , i ll see you again when i m brought back to life with the dragon balls ! kuririn ! kuririn ! now ! ! run ! ! tha th one you re next ! no"
"have they been done in ? t that can t be it ! if goten and trunks have been beaten , then that leaves no one to protect the earth ! still , something has to turn up ! as long as the dragon balls are left on earth ! i it s no use ! we haven t even opened up a pinpoint hole ! while we re in here doing this , time keeps passing on rapidly out there ! this is bad ! everyone will be ! sheesh , got no choice , huh ? guess i have to use that"
"here goes , dearie ! ha ai ! t toss ! ultra boo boo attack ! ! yahoo ! i am in perfect form ! h he would have been all right just now , even if i hadn t helped out , right ? yahoo ! wow ! ! it looks just like a meteor fell here ! ooh ! i m scared ! piccolo san ! come on , come on , you have to say ha ai ! would you cut that out ! ? what happened to boo ? he s here , he s here ! yahoo ! nicely done , goten and trunks ! i it s not over yet ! please , you must be careful to the very end ! goten san ! trunks san ! yo , yo , yo ! majin boo ! come on out ! i know you aren t going to keel over from just this ! get on with it ! i can only stay this ridiculously strong for a little while longer , after all ! it will take another hour before i can become like this again ! huh ? maybe he really did die"
"you ve got me there ! i guess that was a little disappointing , huh ? i wonder if i ve gotten too strong ! look out ! super gotenks exhibits ferocious strength ! however , what s more fearsome is majin boo s depth of strength ! who will come out the victor in this battle of the strongest ?"
"truly great ! ! a reborn gohan returns to earth phew ! that was a close one ! i if the earth had taken that head on , it would have been wiped out without a trace ! you dirty bastard ! you ve done it now , you boo boo swine ! here i go ! renzoku shine shine continuous die die missiles ! stop , you fool ! are you trying to blow away the earth as we know it ! ? it s okay , isn t it ? after all , there s nobody alive down there ! don t forget that the dragon balls are scattered all over the earth ! if you destroy even one of them , we can never return the earth back to the way it was again ! oh , is that right ? well , that s okay"
"in other words , majin boo is flustered , right ? i guess that would be true ! my strength leaves nothing to be desired , after all ! you could say i m the strongest in the universe ! don t let your guard down , gotenks ! if you get too over confident , you ll be hurting later ! he s going to start coming at you like his life depends on it now ! i don t mind , i don t mind ! i hope he does ! damn it all ! our hero left himself wide open ! why , you ! let me go , you big ! oww ! you re not getting away with that any more ! hang in there , goten ! trunks ! t they re incredible ! to think they can fight blow for blow with majin boo ! i wonder how much longer"
"if it s not soon , then i won t be in time you scum ! i m going to put you away here and now ! yea ! ! dammit ! this hurts ! gotenks ! why , you ! huh ! ? now i m mad ! you ve made me furious ! d don t get irritated , gotenks ! you rotten ! back at you ! ! awesome ! awesome ! gohan won t get a turn like this ! now to finish you ! i ll blow you to pieces , then into little chunks , then to shreds , then to bits ! this time , you won t be able to return to normal ! once i blow you apart , i m going to completely wipe you out with my ki , you see ? die ! ! h huh ? u uh oh ! h he went back to normal ! hey ! yeah , you got me , you got me ! how funny , how funny ! i it s hopeless ! i it s all over now ! damn ! say , old man kaioshin sama ! hurry it up ! the little runts fusion has powered down ! really , father ? yeah ! they re going to get killed like this ! okay , you can go ! you ve been finished for a while now"
"w why didn t you tell us sooner ! ? you were just saying that since i got distracted , it was going to take longer , didn t you ! ? ignorant fool ! it s more dramatic for you to go once there s a pinch , you know ! t this is awful ! in that case , i have to hurry ! a at this point , bluffing and anything else is fine ! all right ! super ghost kamikaze attack ! ! i may have returned to my normal form , but the force of my techniques has been powered up ! go ahead , ghosts ! knock majin boo flat ! hey , what should we do ? no way i m doing that ! he looks pretty strong ! stop fussing around and go get him ! all right ! now , while i still can run ! ! h how do i become the mightiest of warriors , with strength beyond my limits ? ah , well , you transform into that super whatever you call it often enough"
"that super whatever thing is depraved ! gohan san , quickly , to earth ! if we don t hurry , the irreparable will happen ! come with us , and we ll go to earth ! no , i shall take gohan san there alone"
"begging your pardon , but if both of us go , we will only be slowing him down , will we not ? i do not want to get in the way of this magnificent savior"
"if you please sorry , gohan"
"i ll do everything i can , and if it s not enough , i ll die alongside you"
"do everything you can ! ? you ve got to be kidding ! piccolo san , you know darn well this is the guy not even fusion could stand up to ! right ! right ! piccolo san , you re an adult , so maybe you re fine with it , but we re still children , and we d definitely hate to die ! what should we do , trunks kun ? okay , then ! having come to this having come to this ? let s sincerely apologize ! he s pretty simple , so if we give him one of his favorite candies and apologize , he might unexpectedly forgive us ! that s it ! maybe he will forgive us ! if he does , ha ha , we can buy enough time for our next fusion ! n now , come on all right , goten ! let s get some candy ready right now ! but there aren t any stores anywhere around"
"i know ! let s tug on this and see ! if he s playing possum on us , he s sure to be surprised and open his eyes ! here goes ! a little farther what ! ? y you idiots ! goten ! trunks ! w what are you guys trying to do , intentionally wake him up now that he s so kindly gone to sleep ! ? i don t know what he s planning , but right now it doesn t matter ! in any case , we have to do whatever it takes to buy some time , and get ready for your next fusion ! that s the only way we can defeat him ! got it ? okay what ! ? w what ki is this ! ? someone s coming ! who is it ! ? t they re strong ! this is a fantastic ki ! i i don t know it ! who can it be ! ? is it a new enemy ? or is it instead ? i it s goku ! ! no it isn t ! it s big brother ! big brother ! gohan san ! ? w what ? it couldn t be ! thank goodness i m in time ! gohan san big brother ! thank goodness ! you weren t dead , huh ? nah"
"what about everyone else ? they were killed by majin boo ! what ! ? including mom and dende and the others ? that s right ! everyone except for us ! that s done it ! to think that even dende had been killed ! how can this be ! ? the dragon balls , upon which everything depends , have vanished ! they were delicious ! i ate them , after i turned them into choco ! no , that s not true ! i can feel it ! a faint ki hey , don t tell me you intend to fight me ! no"
"hmph ! i knew that without having to be lectured by you fellas ! after all , how many years do you think i ve been alive ! ? everyone together making a fool of the old guy ! that s not how it is ! hang in there , gohan ! the future of earth rests on your shoulders ! i remember ! you re the guy i blew away earlier ! you re going to kill me ? looks like you want to get blown away by me once again ! i it s hopeless ! judging from his ki , gohan has powered up , but no matter how much , there s no way he can win by fighting him head on ! i it s too dangerous ! we have to use fusion and fight together with him ! we can t ! we can t do that until an hour has gone by ! i know ! but let s at least try to do what we can ! after all , at this rate , big brother will be ! goten all right ! let s try to fight together , even if it is hopeless ! all right ! n now you ve done it ! b big brother ! a awesome ! way to go , gohan san ! what s the matter ? weren t you going to blow me away ? i will blow you away ! i will blow you away ! i will blow you away ! ! unbelievable ! what the hell has happened to him ? it s hard to believe he s the same gohan ! and he s not even super saiyan , but that power ! way to go , big brother ! that level of attack couldn t have had any effect on you"
"you were testing me , just to make sure that i really was greater than you that s too bad , huh majin boo ? y you mean that even during the height of that battle , he had already become conscious of gohan s existence ? i in that case , what in the world was the meaning of that fight with gotenks ! ? listen , and listen well ! i will not stand for you ! absolutely not ! absolutely not , absolutely not ! i won t stand for you ! ! i ll kill you ! ! kill me , you say ? you must know better than anyone else that such a thing is impossible"
"he blew himself up , didn t he ? he tried to take you with him , gohan san ! if he had been trying to take me with him , he would have made it even bigger so much so that there would be nothing left of earth"
but it does seem as if he s planning something
"ha ! even if he is really alive , there s no problem ! that jerk was powerless to stop gohan san ! he s as strong as we were as super gotenks ! even stronger ! really ? yeah , just a little"
"if you had died , the dragon balls would be ordinary stones"
"that s our mister popo ! he s made an excellent determination ! h hey , who is he ? that kid over there with the sickly complexion ? now see here ! what do you mean , kid ! ? that s kami sama ! kami sama ! w what did you say ? whew , thank goodness ! um what are these dragon balls that you have been talking about for a while now ? never mind that , what in the world does majin boo plan to do ? there s no way he can win ! w w w what ! ? v v videl has been killed ! ? b boo killed v videl ! ? t t that can t be ! ! videl ! videl ! hey , you ! why didn t you protect videl ! ? why didn t you ! ? i m sorry it s okay , pops ! they can come back to life , after all ! c come back to life ? really ? videl can come back to life , right ? really ! really ! really ! you re not lying to me , are you ? if you re lying , i ll make you swallow a thousand needles ! it s majin boo ! what ! ? boo , you say ? t that can t be ! is he already intent on fighting again ? what could have changed in just the hour or so that has gone by ? i ll finish him off this time for sure ! everyone , be careful not to get caught in between us ! okay , show me what has changed ! boo ! why have you killed everyone ! ? you promised me , didn t you ? that you wouldn t kill any more ? boo ! don t you know who i am ? it s no use ! he s not the same boo he was before ! l look ! this is the cute little guy you saved ! see how lively he s gotten ? i told you , it s useless ! stop it , already ! you ll get in the way of gohan s fighting"
"boo s worst foul ! ! gotenks is absorbed ! ? what happened to all those high spirits you showed earlier ? what was that ? you say we re afraid ! ? you don t get it at all , do you ! ? if we hadn t returned to normal earlier , we would have completely won that fight ! i don t know about that"
"you seemed to be pretty scared , if that was supposed to be the case"
"you ve got to be joking ! we can t just sit quietly after having been defied that badly ! big brother , you just don t know how strong we are when we go through fusion ! we ll show you right now , so just give us some room ! that s right ! do it now ! that fusion or whatever thing ! all right , let s go , goten ! yeah ! this time , let s start out right away as super gotenks ! fu fu sion ha ! ! oh , so this is fusion ? yea ! dum dum dum dum ! it s the grim reaper of justice , super gotenks ! i incredible for two people to become one person t that can t be so ! all right ! if i can just add those pipsqueaks power and that piccolo guy s brains i is this not a trick ? w what is it , at a time like this ? are you hungry ? tough it out , i m starving myself"
"and so i thought that if i were to absorb the super gotenks or whoever the runts were i was fighting with at the time into myself , then no matter what matter of fellow might show up , my throne as the mightiest of all would not be shaken"
"i don t think this is the proper thing to do either , but it cannot be helped if we are to save the earth"
"not yet , not yet ! as long as i have time remaining , i will have you entertain me ! h hey , he s getting beaten ! he s getting beaten up ! y you should take the dog and run far away ! you ll be caught up in this ! hey , if it comes to that and as a martial arts champion , i hate to have to use it this"
"o okay these certainly are awesome , old timer ! so , how long can we stay combined ? the potara don t have that sort of shortcoming ! it s forever ! there s nothing to return you back to normal again ! never return ? what a fix staying combined with gohan that whole time if it were possible , then i for one would have returned you mean to say , old timer , that you combined with someone using the potara ? y yeah"
"i wonder if perhaps , once peace is restored , i ll have to start going to gohan s school like this"
it doesn t appear as if you have powered up any
"i it s hopeless ! our dimensions are too different ! i won t be any help at all ! shall i get around to settling this now ? i ll destroy the whole earth , and you small fry along with it , with this ! try to avoid it , if you can ! f forgive me , majin boo ! die ! ! oh , yeah ! should i use these potara things after i ve turned super saiyan ? no"
"ah , really ? if you re going to become super saiyan , it s better to do it after you ve combined"
"and even if you don t do so , the power from just the potara should just be enough"
"an exceptional power up item , you say ? what nonsense ! you re exaggerating ! to be frank , no matter what you might do , there s absolutely no way you can even damage me ! you sure hurried to put your body back together , considering that , didn t you ? you re not thinking something is going to happen , are you ? small fry ! you sure seem to want to get killed ! very well ! gohan ! here ! pick it up ! gohan ! hurry ! right ! put that on your right ear ! you ll combine with me , and we ll defeat boo ! w where is it ! ? what ! ? combine with him ? so that s it ! even if you do so , i think it ll be worthless , but just to make sure , let me intervene"
"this is great ! i m much more powered up than before ! but this time , there is no time limit ! i i can t combine with gohan now ! i it s no use ! i ll have to do it with someone else ! t tenshinhan is down m mister satan ? at length , majin boo has also absorbed gohan ! will goku s merging companion be mister satan after all ? what will you do , goku ! ? can you beat majin boo ! ?"
"even if i do merge with him , it won t mean any more power"
"three ! i it s no use ! with satan , it would be like a power of rising to a power of , and we couldn t beat him ! or worse , if i m unlucky , i could even become weaker , couldn t i ? four ! damn ! it s all or nothing ! satan ! catch this ! that ki ! i it s a huge ki ! it couldn t be ! t this is as far as i bring you"
"vegeta ! all right ! it really is you ! k kakarrot ! g goku ! hey ! w why are you here ! ? you aren t supposed to return to this world again ! this can t be possible ! v vegeta san ! good timing ! if he combines with that man , something could just turn out ! w why is vegeta san there ? everyone who goes to hell is supposed to have their souls cleansed , have their memories taken away , and become a new life form"
"majin boo is coming this way at ultra speed ! ba chan , hurry and run away to the other world ! y you re right ! good luck , the both of you ! i ll be pulling for you in the other world ! i thought you d already been wiped out in hell ! yama sama sure did something crafty , to leave you the way you were , didn t he ? there ain t time ! vegeta , don t talk , just put this on your right ear ! please ! why ? if you put this on too , then you and i can merge together ! merge ? that s right ! our powers will be multiplied together , and a warrior with absurd power will be born ! don t be ridiculous ! how can i believe that ? v vegeta ! there s another person there with a large power ! however , naturally , they re no match for me ! even if they were to combine together ! vegeta ! there ain t nothing else we can do , if we re going to beat majin boo ! why should i have to unite with you ! ? if i m to become one with you , i d rather be wiped out ! i ve found you ! h he s here ! stop it , vegeta ! you re simply no match for him ! please ! put this on ! i refuse ! it s the same , no matter how many times you say it ! move it ! all right , come on ! you , huh ? we ve fought before"
"your excuses don t matter ! it doesn t change the fact that when you fought me , you were holding back ! i have been made a fool of ! this fighting between yourselves is getting all too annoying ! if you re not going to come at me , then i ll go at you ! dammit ! all right ! now ! it s hopeless ! no matter what we do , we can t win ! the earth and everything else are going to be blown away ! it s the end of everything ! hmph ! do i care ! ? vegeta , everyone was eaten by boo ! including kuririn , and chichi and bulma too ! piccolo too , and gohan , goten , and even trunks were absorbed by that guy ! that s what boo s sudden power up is due to ! everyone will have died for nothing like this ! we re going to be killed here , without being able to offer any resistance ! is that okay with you , vegeta ! ? kakarrot ! if we merge , will we really be able to win against boo ? i don t know"
"i wondered what was going to happen , but it appears as if they successfully combined together"
"my apologies ! i m still not used to this body ! but i m okay now ! this time , we ll get started for sure ! let s do that ! if you were to have died on me like this , i would have been greatly disappointed ! the fun is just beginning ! n now you ve done it ! the grand kaioshin sama was right"
"indeed i have gotten stronger ! enough to be able to kill you ! enough of you being carried away with yourself ! i was planning on playing around with you a bit more , but i m not going to hold back any longer ! i m sending you to the next world right now ! if you can do it , go ahead and try ! i incredible ! it s incredible ! to think that he can fight toe to toe with majin boo after he powered up that much ! toe to toe , you say ? look , you , where in the world are you directing your eyes ? open up your eyes and watch closely ! boo is the majin is being overcome ! he can win ! at this pace , he can win against majin boo ! right , grand kaioshin sama ? no ! we cannot tell"
"however , see , if he doesn t win , you see , then there s probably nobody else that can win against him , see ? we re counting on you ! goku san ! vegeta san ! n not bad how do you like this ? how about it ? did you find him ? mm mm"
"leave that to me , if you please ! what ? is that don t tell me ! yes , that s right ! there s enough energy gathered in here to smash the planet to smithereens ! will you indeed be able to stop this ? if you fear for your life , you can also dodge it ! however , once it falls to the ground , it s all over the earth will be blown away ! without a trace , in an instant ! now what will you do ! ? hide yourself around here , if you would"
"y you don t think that everyone has been killed already , do you ? don t you say anything dire like that again ! c chichi , what are you doin , gussied up like that ? t those are lunch san s i can t take it anymore ! i m goin to rescue gohan ! d don t be ridiculous ! if you go now , you re goin to be killed ! i don t care ! i m goin to die together with gohan ! h hold on , now ! chichi ! calm down ! let me go , pa ! let me go ! let go of me ! i i m goin ! pa ! let go of me ! i m goin ! i m goin ! i m goin ! i m goin ! now see here , chichi ! you re goin to get killed ! i m tellin you no ! i m goin to go rescue gohan chan ! come on , re think this ! i m goin where gohan is ! chichi ! tenshinhan yamucha son kun l believe in you"
"nappa ! kill them ! if all four of them team up , it could be a problem for us ! it will also serve as a warning to kakarrot ! what ! ? but what about the dragon balls ? i don t care ! i have an idea"
"if we go to planet namek , the home world of that namekian , i m sure that there will be dragon balls that are even more powerful"
"i thought they were just worthless stories , but if kakarrot really has come back to life , then those legends are true after all"
"i ll start with you ! p piccolo san , run ! i ll stop him one way or another until father gets here ! what ! ? after all , if you die , piccolo san , then kami sama dies too , and the dragon balls will you re talking nonsense ! there s no way you can stop him by yourself ! stop me , you say ? me ? i if this keeps up , there won t be any going back i it s no use i can t move don t make me laugh , you brat ! no ! i incredible ! d did he get him ? why , you brat ! this is where it ends ! n no ! goku die ! ! who who are you ? they re sour ! piccolo leaps in to rescue gohan from his pinch"
"hmph , of course , you probably wouldn t understand if i explain it to you verbally"
"you re right ! if you can t understand something you re told , all that s left is to make you understand by force ! you miserable fool ! the likes of you ! what about the likes of me ? your nose is bleeding"
"get our turns nothing , if our opponent is someone that goku and vegeta couldn t handle , there s no way we could win , is there ? that is true hold on if we don t get a turn ulp ! are we going to lose our bodies and be turned into ordinary spirits ? you don t have to worry"
"what are you going to do ? you want to continue ? you are one distasteful creep ! and yet , with all those many guys you ve merged with , if that s all you ve got , i m fairly disappointed"
"disappointed , you say ? in me ? in me , the strongest in the universe ! ? that s enough of you making a fool out of me ! make a fool out of me , will you ? me ! ? me ! ? incredible power ! you can manage it if you just try , can t you ? you ll pay for that ! you can t ! you mustn t anger majin boo any further ! what do you mean ? there was a time when majin boo was sealed up in the room of spirit and time"
"look at this , if you would"
"make a fool out of me , will you ? make a fool out of me , will you ! ? this is bad ! he s gotten completely fired up ! if i don t stop him , this universe will be crushed by alternate dimensions ! what the hell happened to me ? that was close , that was close ! you sure do have awesome power , huh ? in which case , use that power to come hit me ! you were going to defeat me as proof to all , right ? that you are the strongest in the universe ? why the hell is he taking so long ! ? hurry up and defeat majin boo ! ultra powers clash between majin boo and vegetto"
it wouldn t be going like this if goku was by himself
"if you were to just be wiped clean out , then not even you could return to normal again"
"d damn it all ! s shortly ? why doesn t he just defeat him all at once ? if he lets him alone , he could release that power that can even break down the walls between dimensions ! he must be playing around"
"could you make me get serious about this before too much longer ? see here ! finish him off right now ! are you planning on amusing yourself some more by getting boo angry ? just what might his intentions be ? damn , it looks like he s gotten too strong ! that idiot ! if you get too confident of your power , things aren t going to go well ! i told you , the important thing to grasp is the movement of ki ! didn t you listen to what i said ? s shut up ! that was dirty of you merging yourselves together ! that s a fine thing for you to say , when you re the one who kept merging together with all those others ! come on , come on , what s the matter ? just my legs are enough against the likes of you ! why , you ! gohan san ! gohan kun ! hey , gohan ! come on out ! gohan kun ! where are you ! ? where in the world could that gohan have gone to ? please , do not lose heart , chichi san"
"i , dabura , will be certain to locate gohan san , even if it costs me my life ! now , look here"
"videl san i m sorry , i can t express it well sure , right ? i believe you too ! gohan kun is still alive ! if you believe in your wishes if you keep believing in them , they will surely come true some time ! and as for me , i wan t gohan kun to be alive ! bulma san a young maiden in love is strong , you know ! why , i ! is this true ? i believe as well , videl san ! surely , surely gohan san is alive ! indeed he is ! ah , this must be what is called affection ! how beautiful it is ! how marvelous it is ! you still don t seem to fully understand , so under the circumstances , i ll explain it to you bluntly"
"even if that s so , there s a whole different dimension of strength between us and majin boo"
"i wonder if there are any cute , bubbly girls around"
"okay , now what are you going to do ? your opponent is the strongest hard candy in the universe ! don t be absurd ! even if you can move , you re still nothing more than hard candy ! and as a hard candy , what can you do ! ? are you sure you want to ask something like that ? besides , are you sure it s not too dangerous ? being this small , it ll be hard for you to attack me"
"what s wrong ? weren t you going to catch me and eat me ? if you won t come at me , then i ll go at you ! now i ll eat you ! damn you , whizzing around like that ! my , my , that was inexcusable"
"what were you planning to do if he were still a hard candy ? well , it could be that he took into account that this might have happened"
"if you were to die as such , it will be no more than a dog s death"
i wonder if kaio sama will put up the repair costs for me
"well , i m starting to count ! one ! two ! three ! if you want to rush your death , you can come at me ! i ll wipe you out in an instant ! without a trace ! four ! five ! six ! damn"
"maybe this is different and if so that guy is really something else ! that was a close one ! goku san vegeta san h hey , what the hell is going to happen to earth ! ? there are no longer any warriors left that can fight majin boo"
it d be nice if they aren t already dead
"t the potara ! v vegeta ! how could you do that ! ? now we ain t capable of merging again , you know ! on top of that , you re dead ! unless you re merged , you ll have to go back to the other world , right ! ? hmph ! i ll take that over being merged with you ! besides , there s no need to merge again , is there ? you don t know that ! even if we do rescue everyone who has been absorbed successfully , there ain t any guarantee boo will return to the way he was"
"what s this smoke ? y you idiot ! that s his stomach acid ! if you re not quick , you ll be dissolved without a trace ! what s that ? that bastard ! he s planning on digesting us ! w we re surrounded ! t this is bad ! if this keeps up stop ! vegeta ! yow ! w what was that just now ? have i eaten something bad ? i know ! this is because i absorbed that strange guy ! it must be causing indigestion ! hey , vegeta , you sure are reckless ! what do you plan on doing if majin boo finds us out ? after all the trouble it took to sneak in here ! hmph ! what do i care ? i saved us from being dissolved"
"more importantly , you stay sharp , kakarrot ! if we don t find gohan and the others soon , we won t be able to save the earth that we otherwise might have been able to"
"stop saying such rubbish ! after shrugging off the pounding we gave him , it d be a big laugh if he were to die from eating too much candy ! that s for sure ! what s wrong ? silence ! what s that sound ? above us ? what ! ? what are these disgusting things ? that thing tried to dissolve me ! they ve got incredible appetites ! apparently , these things break down what majin boo eats , and supply him with nourishment"
"s say , vegeta , could it be that these things are about to eat us ? if that s the case , let s show them that we re not all that appetizing"
"y you don t mean ? here they come ! geez , these things are stubborn ! hey , vegeta , if you make that big a commotion , majin b why , you rotten scum ! kakarrot ! what s that ! ? what ? what is that monster ! ? what the hell are you doing , kakarrot ! ? tear those lower life forms off of you ! i know ! but my body is ! suddenly , goku finds himself in a great pinch with the giant monster that has appeared ! will he be able to weather this pinch , and rescue gohan and the others ? there is barely any time remaining before majin boo destroys the earth !"
"and i was even trying to hold back quite a bit , at that ! big brother ! big brother ! big brother ! big brother ! poppa ! it s big brother ! p poppa ? i ve got an awfully bad feeling about this ! k kakarrot ! despite how i may seem , i cannot stand squirmy things ! sure enough , here he comes ! i think i m gonna vomit ! poppa ! those guys were bullying us ! hey , kakarrot ! we ve already been found out from what happened earlier ! no need to worry about that any more , right ? well , i don t know h hey , vegeta ! w what ! ? poppa , hurry up and put those guys away ! yeah , yeah ! what did you do that for , poppa ? you ve done something naughty again , haven t you ! ? how many times do i have to tell you before you understand ? i told you , you can t go straying off so far from the herd ! you really don t listen to a thing your poppa says ! um , has this boy committed any misdeeds ? misdeeds ? i if that face moves any closer , i ll kill him ! you see , this boy has the bad habit of taking off after anything he sees moving"
"y you can t mean it ! w w why ! ? after he so graciously went away ? if the earth is destroyed , then it will be the same no matter where we are ! we have to do something to him ! w w what do you mean , do something ? boo has gone off looking for something to eat"
"if we go outside like this , we ll be beaten for sure ! in that case , what else would you have us do ? huh ? this is because you re the one who broke your potara ! in that case , you can live out your life inside boo s head"
"i ll turn you into choco ! then maybe everyone else who was turned into choco and eaten could be around somewhere , huh ? they aren t ! he s the only one to get special treatment"
"here i thought things were strange , and sure enough , it s your doing what s going on ! ? w why is majin boo showing up inside himself ! ? i don t know how this happened , but it seems you weren t absorbed ! how dare you remove the others i took so much trouble to absorb ! ? damn , t this could be bad ! this is why i told you to keep the potara on , you know ! once we re outside , if we could only merge , this guy would be easy to beat ! is that so ? you guys cannot merge any more , then ? you idiot ! if you d kept quiet , he wouldn t have known that ! you don t say"
"you don t say , then ! all right , if you re coming , then come on ! i ll open up a giant hole here inside your body ! what are you laughing about ? you don t think i can open one ? it s impossible ! don t you belittle me"
"no way it could have ! let s go , vegeta ! don t you give me orders ! how long are you going to stick on me ! ? hurry up and get away from me ! take care of the fragments from majin boo ! r right ! that bastard if i d known this , i d have rather merged with him ! yo , vegeta ! are you done there , too ? stay back , kakarrot ! what ! ? have you forgotten what place this is ? where are you , boo ! ? bastard ! this is the inside of my body ! inside here , i am immortal ! don t you understand ! ? why , you ! blow me to pieces , and i still won t die ! the reason being , i am boo ! s shut up ! shut up ! shut up ! shut up ! ! shut up ! ! vegeta , take it easy ! don t fall for boo s taunting ! huh ? are you trying to kill your friends who you worked so hard to rescue ? that was dirty , boo ! where s boo ? like i told you ! it s impossible for you to beat me ! i m getting tired of this"
what would happen if i rip this guy out ? i wonder if it might be somewhat advantageous to us
"w which way are we supposed to go ! ? how do i know ? hey , for some reason , that area there is starting to wriggle around ! he must be transforming again ! either into the fatso or the skinny guy ! f for some reason , it s getting incredibly hot ! w what s this ? the temperature of boo s cells is increasing sharply ! a at this rate , both of us will be boiled octopuses ! kakarrot ! are you okay ! ? damn it all ! ain t there an exit anywhere ? that was incredibly hot ! not even magma is like that ! if we had been touched by that , not even our bones would be left ! vegeta , look ! it s a little bit bright over there"
"even if he were blown to bits , he d soon return to normal again"
"hey , boo ! if you re going to blow up this planet , that s up to you , but how about you do it after you ve fought us ! ? that s more like it"
"and this is not earth , but probably the holy land of the kaioshin realm ! you re taking this joke too far ! if those geezers are so awesome , then why don t they do something about boo ? w well , they he sure gets you where it hurts , huh ? and i thought it was suspicious that someone like you would be kami sama in the first place"
"so that s it ! i finally figured it out ! it s a dream ! this is a dream ! that s it ! a dream ! ah , i get it ! here i thought that things were weird ! after all , there s no way that anyone stronger than i , the world champion , could exist in this world , is there ? there really is no majin boo , and these guys are just strange characters in my dream ! that would be consistent ! i thought that things starting with the tenkaichi tournament were weird right from the beginning ! u um that s right ! if this is a dream , i think i ll try to fly through the air , too ! u um ! listen well , majin boo ! this may be a dream , but how dare you kill my cute daughter videl , and blow the earth away ! i , mister satan , will fly into space , and put you down ! i m going to fly ! t that hurt ! ! it hurt ! it s a dream , yet it still hurt ! it hurt ! he s quite an amusing fellow , huh ? kakarrot ! you let piccolo and gohan and the others , who we worked so hard to rescue , die instead of that big idiot ! there s no bringing them back ! our last hope , the dragon balls , were wiped out along with earth , after all ! look at this ! after being blown to pieces , majin boo is returning to normal ! dammit ! it s him , all right ! if any fragment of majin boo remains , then no matter where he is , he will recover"
"and even if we are able to defeat boo , we can t return earth , or those other planets , back the way they were"
"t that s it ! there still are some dragon balls ! there are , aren t there ? if we go to my home planet of namek , i m sure the new elder sama will still have the dragon balls made ! they can be returned ! the earth , and the other planets ! and all those many people who were killed by boo , too ! t that s it ! no , hold on ! dende , planet namek is pretty far away , huh ? the ki from planet namek ain t all that large , so it would be kind of impossible to get there with my instantaneous movement"
"great ! that does it ! in that case , once we defeat boo , things will work out fine ! h hold on ! you must not use those dragon balls ! they invite confusion into the natural order ! they are only permitted to the somber namekians , and possess , as it were , capability that runs afoul ! long ago , they were advised to only use them on planet namek ! in fact , the old namekians would absolutely not use them on matters of other planets ! don t be so rigid , old timer ! you know what ? if things go well , i ll take some steamy , dirty photos of a woman i know , and give you the unedited prints ! d dirty photos ? there , see ? you want them , right ? she s not all that young , but she still has her bounce ! but this woman has been killed , right ? that s why we should bring her back to life with the dragon balls , shouldn t we ? hey , kakarrot ! yes ? this woman don t tell me you re talking about bulma , are you ? s so it is , huh ! ? why , you ! use other people s wives as you like , will you ! ? you can give him those of your own wife photos of chichi s chi chis ! n no she ain t got any more bounce left , and i d get killed ! j just a moment ! boo is about to move again ! he is seeking out goku san and vegeta san s ki ! bravo ! yamucha ! let s go ! come on , kuririn ! it s ! m majin boo ! w who is he ? has he come to train ? what s the matter , kaio of the north ? it s majin boo ! so , he s finally come here , huh ? boo has at length gotten to the grand kaio s world"
"if he s coming , let him come ! hey , give your potara over to goku and vegeta"

"see here ! what are you planning to do ? stop that ! stop that ! boo is planning to destroy the grand kaio s world too ! t that s bad ! kuririn and yamucha have already died once ! if they die again , then this time , they ll be completely eliminated ! all right ! instantaneous movement ! wait , kakarrot ! let s call him here ! it won t be so easy , in this holy kaioshin realm , for everything to be destroyed ! we can fight as much as we want ! but how do we do that ? we re the ones he s after ! we ll raise our ki and let him know that we are here ! t that s it ! all right ! no matter how much we do it , it s no use ! damn ! i ll turn into chocolate , or a biscuit , or anything you want , just stop ! s stop ! ! it s all over ! you ve had it ! i it vanished ! boo ! it hurts ! it hurts ! at last , majin boo has come to the holy kaioshin realm"
"here , even if the kaioshin realm is destroyed , we should not be affected"
"w will they be able to win against majin boo like that ? well , if the two of them put their powers together all right ! how about we try smacking him one , to see if we can do anything about this ? yeah"
"what s this ? what s going on ? oh , it s you , is it ? you know what ? where did everyone else go ? i it s him ! and goku , too ! where in the world are they ? it s the kaioshin realm"
"kaio of the north , what are you babbling about ? what in the world is the matter ? you too can spy on things far away , right ? if you look , you ll soon understand"
"die ! ! p piccolo san ! get out of here gohan piccolo san ! w why did you save me ? i i told you to get out of here hurry , or else d don t die ! father will be here soon to beat him for us ! please , don t die ! miserable fool ! my killing order might have gotten switched around , but oh well"
"even if we recover , we won t be much help to you"
"if you don t eat it , i m throwing it away"
"i i just stood by and let everyone else die gohan , i hardly recognized you , too"
"t this is a fierce fight , huh ? e even more than fierce ! hang in there , goku ! w what an awesome fight oni ! if i missed this , i d regret it the rest of my life oni ! that blond guy looks like that guy who fell from the serpentine road before oni"
"and , if you see boo the way i do , he s still just a child"
"even if we are in the middle of a dream , i ll be sure to protect you ! i am the hero of earth , mister satan ! w where are you , boo ? hold on ! watch out ! where the hell is he going to come out from ? where are you ? so , it was there , huh ? dammit ! not even at super saiyan can i keep up with his movements ! he s able to read every movement i m going to make ! that miserable majin boo ! he has terrifying strength it s all or nothing ! this ain t the time to be thinking about exhausting my power ! ka me ha me ha ! ! goku ! w w w what s this ! ? huh ? does majin boo have that many children ! ? kakarrot ! oh , no switch out , kakarrot ! you rest for a little bit ! v vegeta he has ridiculous strength you need to be prepared ! i know"
"stronger than anyone else i ve ever fought before ! but i ain t lost yet ! kakarrot ! kakarrot , you are one incredible guy i was absolutely no match against majin boo"
"so , you ve shown up ? what have you come all this way for , kakarrot ? don t tell me you ve come to say you re going to defeat me , or some other absurd joke , have you ? d damned if i m about to let something like this happen ! i i am the saiyan prince ! i am ultra elite ! there s no way i can be beaten by a lower class warrior like him ! i am the greatest in the universe ! ever since then , i lived with the goal of surpassing you , kakarrot"
"it s said that the legendary super saiyan can only appear in one out of a thousand even if the legend were true , the capacity to become a super saiyan lies within me alone ! there s no way that lower class warrior kakarrot could become a legendary super saiyan ! h he s clearly surpassed the saiyan fighting level"
"at first , i thought it was because you had something to protect that having a strong mind towards defending something gave rise to some mysterious power that certainly may be true , but if that were it , then it would have been the same for me , now"
it s as if you knew that i would now come to have the slightest bit of a heart
gonna kill you ! if i had known it was going to turn out like this i should have finished you off for good when i had become vegetto
"but no matter what , i can t afford to lose ! damn ! my attacks ain t having any effect on him at all any more ! what the hell s the matter ! ? t this is bad ! as a result of the fight being drawn out , goku is just about out of stamina ! how do you like this ! ? even with me repeatedly attacking him at that level , that bastard ain t lost any of his resilience ! he just immediately goes back to being good as new ! kakarrot ! what is it , vegeta ? you want to switch in again ? let me go a little bit longer ! you ve got no intention of switching out again , so quit being so transparent ! you must know as well as i do that even if i were to fight him again , then never mind me not having any chance of winning , i d be killed in a second ! er , no , that s not hmph , don t bother trying to be gracious"
"and you , kakarrot , are too ! vegeta don t hold back for me , finish him off ! with your super saiyan there , if you gather as much ki as you can , you should be able to completely obliterate boo ! yeah i ve been thinking of doing so for a while now , but i just ain t had the chance"
"one minute ? maybe i ve been trying too much to look cool ! i thought things would go better than this ! y you were concerned over me ? that bastard he could return to normal in an instant , but he s dragging it out on purpose just for the fun of it ! of all the how infuriating ! one minute is enough , then ? if you have one minute , you can gather enough ki to annihilate him , right ? y yeah if i had a minute , that is all right ! i ll keep him in check somehow for one minute"
do you know what happens to that kind of guy if he dies again ? they vanish
"you piece of crap ! ! take this ! d do you hear something strange ? not again ! that s great ! if we re lucky , he just might keep up like this for one minute ! damn ! hang in there , vegeta ! one minute if i can hold out for one minute vegeta ! vegeta ! bastard ! hey where do you think you re going ? vegeta ! we re not finished yet ! are you thinking of running away ? you miserable coward ! hurry up and come at me ! come on , what s the matter ! ? you re the mighty majin boo , right ? or are you afraid of me ? big bang attack ! ! what ! ? a little longer just a little longer ! hang on , vegeta ! what s so funny ? y you can t kill me with a wimpy attack like that ! i m not lying after all , i m already dead once ! damned if i m going to be done away with by the likes of you ! i am the warrior saiyan people s prince vegeta ! ! this is bad ! vegeta really is going to get killed for sure this time ! dammit , what are you doing , goku ! ? one minute has already gone by , hasn t it ? how can this be ? it s been one minute i can t wipe out boo with only this much ki ! die ! die , die , die , die ! d damn it all ! i haven t gathered any ki at all ! what s going on ! ? what in the world is the matter , goku ? the only one who can save vegeta now , as well as the whole universe , is you !"
"at this point , even if it s only for one second , we have to buy enough time to let goku san gather even more ki"
"at a time like this , i can t just sit here doing nothing ! thanks ! well then , let s go ! right ! j j just a moment , now ! for the love of would you settle down for a second ? if you boys could go and buy time , i would have long since let you go ! you boys must know well enough that this situation is one where we can no longer do anything ! i know how you re feeling anxious , but there s nothing we can do any more"
"isn t that right ? vegeta ! stay back ! stay back ! of all the who is it you think i m going through all of this for ! ? you hurry up and gather your ki ! this is bad ! no matter how tough vegeta is , there ain t no way he can stand up to that ! i can t stand it any more ! boo ! yo , yo , yo ! i watch on silently , and you get carried away with yourself ! did you think that the world combat sports champion mister satan sama would quietly overlook your brutality ! ? i am going to punish you ! prepare yourself ! you will soon regret having an opponent you can t deal with ! we didn t need this ! he should have just quietly stayed in hiding ! he s nervous , he s nervous ! you re getting a spankie spankie ! yo , yo , yo ! what s the matter ! ? hurry up and come at me ! or are you afraid of mister satan here ? you miserable coward ! i i nailed that ! i nailed that so hard , it s a shame this is a dream ! y you want to go ! ? e even in a dream , this is scary ! i i m sorry ! i i didn t mean any harm ! i just wanted to show off a little ! i was only playing around , and i couldn t help myself ! satan dodged boo s attack ! nice going ! i have to give you more credit , satan ! i m so sorry ! w what is it ? what in the world is wrong ! ? c could it be that he s in awe of my resolve ? i did it , i did it ! i did it ! yo , yo , what s the matter ! ? come on , come on ! suffer some more from the power of my resolve ! w why is this ? why is it that ever since mister satan appeared , boo has been ? c could it really be a result of mister satan s resolve ? k kakarrot ! what the hell are you doing ! ? this is our chance ! gather your ki now , while you can ! yeah , you got it ! b b boo ! ! w what s this ? w what s happening here ? i i know ! that chubby majin boo was friends with mister satan ! with that boo inside his body , he was undergoing rejection , and was incapable of attacking satan ! i see , so that s why he spat him out , is it ? well , even if that satan fellow is done in , it won t have much of an impact"
"h how could you ? he may have a number of character issues , but he is the last survivor of the human race for the time being boo ! boo ! hey ! come on ! snap out of it ! boo ! boo hey , come on b boo b boo and you were such a nice guy , too how how awful ! how dare you do this to boo ! you ll pay ! you re going to pay ! ! why , you ! brace yourself ! i , mister satan , will beat you to a pulp ! w what s with this guy ? you really want to fight ! ? i m warning you , y you d better quit ! to put it frankly , i m too strong for you ! v very well ! if you want to get hurt that badly , i ll let you have it ! come on ! this is my dream , after all so it s only natural that i m the one who will win ! how s that ? have you learned your lesson ? h how can this be ! ? even in my dream , this still hurts ! w why , you ! cut that out ! are you trying to get me really angry ! ? do you really want to get hurt that badly ? if you re going to apologize , now s the time ! w well , that s okay ! maybe i ll just let you off"
"kaioshins ! dende ! can you hear me ! ? you ve got to be watching what s happening on that ball , right ! ? can you hear me ? if you can hear my voice , then answer me ! yeah , we hear you all right ! now then , go immediately to the restored planet namek and scrounge up the dragon balls ! u um , how exactly are stop nattering and get on with it ! we re running out of time ! t the dragon balls , huh ? i m sure vegeta san has some sort of idea ! let s go ! still , those things , you know this is no time for you to be so particular ! how is it wrong to use them for something legitimate ? i i get it"
"sorry to trouble you , but could you just do it ? y yes , understood ! so , what about the third wish ? after those first two , anything s fine ! do whatever you want ! vegeta , about that second wish wouldn t it have been easier to just ask for everyone who had been killed by boo to be brought back to life ? hmph , idiot ! if i d done that , then even babidi and dabura would be brought back to life"
"please , if you would , return it back to the way it was ! okay ! that is a simple task"
"so that s it ! you ve thought this out , huh vegeta ? surely , with a genki dama , we might be able to defeat boo ! hang in there , boo ! that s it ! to the body ! hook ! uppercut ! what s the matter , boo ? if this is my dream , you should definitely be winning ! my boo ! y you turn into candy ! b boo ! shake it off , boo ! say , it s impossible , ain t it ? with a genki dama ? even if i were to gather a little bit of ki from everyone i told you , didn t i ? let the folks on earth take responsibility for a change"
"i i knew this was a dream ! h hey , you guys ! if you ve got time for this worthless spacing off , then help boo out , would you ? we know ! just hold on a moment ! right now , in a certain location , there is a warrior who is fighting majin boo in your place ! however , to be honest , you could say that our odds are pretty bad"
"i it s vegeta ! it s vegeta s voice ! majin boo s strength far exceeds even cell s ! vegeta ! and so , we want to make use of your power ! raise your hands to the sky ! gather your energy together and defeat boo ! it will wear you out considerably , but don t worry ! it will be just like after you run as hard as you can ! now , do it ! raise your hands ! what a lousy approach towards making requests this guy has ! for crying out loud all right , kakarrot ! get started ! right ! not bad , vegeta ! i ve got to give you more credit ! everyone ! share your genki with me ! please ! that s it ! a genki dama ! you got it , papa ! hmph ! vegeta ! this stunt isn t like you ! here it comes , here it comes , here it comes ! it s so huge all of a sudden ! this is from gohan and the others ! ha ! this is awesome , all right ! with just the ki from them , it s already gotten this huge ! that s it ! great ! more ! more ! come on ! more of you , raise your hands ! understood , vegeta ! here ! l like this ? here ! here ! yahoo ! this time it s kuririn and bulma and those guys ki ! way to go , vegeta ! it s working ! it s working ! they ve done it ! goku san ! quickly now , finish boo off ! incredible ! to think that a method such as this still remained ! really , what incredible people they are ! yay ! this is strange ! if they re getting power from all of the folks on earth , then that super genki dama has no business being only that large ! from here on from here on , it will get larger ! i m sure it will ! y yeah polunga , you re certain that everyone who was wished for has come back to life , right ? of course , i am certain"
"don t be fooled by the voice ! it s definitely one of boo s cronies ! he s right ! it s too suspicious ! they haven t been making their identities clear to us ! if we do as that voice says , then something awful is going to happen to us ! it s no use ! it just got a little bit bigger from that ! vegeta ! don t you have it backward , there ? the one who s going to defeat you is going to be me ! hurry ! hurry and give me your genki ! why ! ? why doesn t anyone understand ? t this can t be ! most of the people on earth aren t sharing their genki ! they ve already been hammered by babidi and boo"
"let s go right away ! yeah ! everyone ! please , raise your hands toward the sky ! please ! raise your hands toward the sky ! if we don t , then something terrible will happen to the earth again ! please ! please ! please ! mister ! this isn t the time to be doing that ! the earth is in trouble ! look , enough ! you sure are some annoyin brats ! stop gettin in my way ! everyone , raise your hands ! look to the sky and raise your hands ! here ! i ll give you these , so go off playin somewhere else ! we got these ! h he s here ! run ! hey ! hurry it up , everybody ! don t you care what happens to earth , and the rest of the universe , you stupid bastards ! ? what was that ? stupid bastards ? that s a pretty insolent attitude from someone asking for something ! just ignore them"
"son goku is strongest after all ! ! majin boo is eliminated vegeta ! get out of the way , quickly ! would you shut up ! ? i can t move my body ! y you what ! ? you ve got to give it your all , and somehow get away from there , vegeta ! you ll be caught in the blast ! s stupid bastard ! d don t worry about me ! hurry up and get him , dammit ! d damn you ! v vegeta san ! he can t throw the genki dama like this ! g goku san ! it s that softness that will cost you your lives ! boo ! give it to them , now ! k kakarrot ! if you are one of the fighting saiyan people , then do not hesitate ! yeah , but ! k kakarrot ! vegeta ! dammit ! boo ! boo ! boo ! are you all right ! ? boo ! boo ! boo what on earth ? no ! goku ! if you get finished off , then that genki dama you worked so hard for means nothing ! give it to him , goku ! give it to him ! d damn it all ! it s no use ! vegeta , i m sorry ! satan ! s so that s it ! all right ! i m sorry , boo ! damn it , man , do it ! ! put him away now ! ! nice work , satan ! you really could be the world s savior ! ! burn in hell ! go ! ! w what ! ? dammit ! go , go ! ! do you hear me , gohan ? yes , piccolo san"
"if it s the kaioshin realm , then unless kibit san were here , we can t go to their aid"
"we should be able to feel goku and the others ki more strongly there ! right ! hey , squirts ! you guys come too ! hurry ! d dammit ! t this ain t just my power here ! this is the genki of all earthlings ! t that s why there ain t no way no way i can allow us to lose ! ! piccolo ! gohan ! gohan kun you dummy , you dummy ! i was so worried about you ! u um , you don t need to cry so hard w what s this ! ? are you leavin me , your own ma out ! ? you re my gohan ! now , now , it s all right , isn t it ? it d look bad if he had a mother complex"
"we miscalculated ! there s not enough strength left in kakarrot , which is so critical in throwing the genki dama ! dammit ! t this is bad ! i wonder if that genki dama thing is still lacking a little bit of power"
"i it can t be ! i i m sorry , vegeta san ! our power is gone as well , and we cannot come there ! then it s all or nothing ! hey , satan , gather the genki from those guys on earth one more time ! raise the power of the genki dama , and squash that boo bastard ! make it fast ! w wait , vegeta ! you can t do that ! everyone has yet to recover their strength ! if you suck out their genki again , everyone will die ! are you trying to take the earthlings you brought back to life and kill them all again ? you shut up , kaio ! if we lose to boo like this now , they can t remain alive anyhow ! now , do it ! power up the genki dama ! hurry it up ! there s no time ! i it s no use ! i can t muster the power ! understood"
"stop , mister satan ! provided that this was all my all in my dream what ? however , this is no dream ! i can t believe it , but this is reality ! i m sorry , but i cannot do anything that would allow the people of earth to die ! hey ! listen to me well ! we can just bring back to life those who die again with the dragon balls ! besides , we still have our third wish left , and so ! that s it ! dende ! the third wish ! t that s right ! do you still not have a third wish ? in that case , if you would allow me to disappear w wait ! polunga san ! c can you raise the strength of the person named son goku , who is now fighting majin boo in the kaioshin realm , back to normal ? if all i must do is return that person s level of strength to its usual level , then it is possible"
"thank goodness ! d do that right away , if you please ! okay ! i i it s no use ! goku san ! with the third wish , goku san , your strength should be returning to normal ! it s back ! it s back ! ! thank you , dragon balls ! he did it ! very , very nice ! way to go ! father s ki ! it suddenly swelled up ! you are awesome ! you fought well , all by yourself ! you changed forms so many times so much so that i was finally getting tired of it"
"do you get it ? we re saved ! what is it ? hey ! where are you going ? thank you ! b boo ! what ! ? h he s still alive ! p please , heal him ! you can heal him , right ? with that mysterious power ? don t be ridiculous ! you have to be joking ! move ! i m going to finish him off ! s stop ! please stop ! h he s not all that bad a guy ! he was just ordered around by bad people , that s why he did what he did ! why , you don t you get it ! ? what do you intend to do if he gives rise to that devastating boo again ! ? w well , in that case next time for sure , the world will probably come to an end ! killing him now while we can is for the best ! you got that ! ? w what made him become evil was when that idiotic guy killed this dog ! p please ! i beg you ! i will take responsibility for him , and keep him under my protection at my home ! protection ! ? don t make me laugh ! with your power , what the hell can you do ! ? get out of the way , now ! or do you want to die with him ! ? w why , you ! dende , heal boo for me , would you ? what did you say ! ? are you out of your mind ? aw , it s all right , ain t it vegeta ? both this boo and mister satan did well by us"
"if these two hadn t been here , we would have all had it"
"right ? besides that , if the worst happens , we can just fight him again"
"oh , well , if boo can put up with not going out for about half a year , the dragon balls will be re activated , and if we ask shen long , we can have him erase all memories of boo from everybody on earth ! my , my , not the dragon balls again"
"do what you want ! whatever happens is no concern of mine ! t thank you ! really , thank you ! okay , dende , if you would"
"oh , there s so much here , isn t there ? welcome ! vanilla , choco , strawberry we have all kinds ! which would you like ? let s see everything ! h hold on ! i still haven t gotten your money ! what is money ? what ? stop kidding around ! if you don t have any money , then give that back ! give me back my ice ! if you want it so badly , come back with some money ! satan said it s not good to get angry"
"who is this guy ? money money ice ice money ice come on , come on ! if you can skillfully defeat this gentleman , you will receive a great deal of money ! all of one hundred thousand zeni ! how about it ? do we have any courageous challengers ? the cost to fight is a mere ten thousand zeni ! come on , fight ! fight ! you go on ! don t be stupid ! he s a master of kung fu ! there s no way i can beat him , you know ! can i really get a great deal of money ? of course ! that is , if you can fight me and win"
"oh , it s just a game ! ? all right ! if you need money , i ll put it up ! it s a cheap price to pay to watch an interesting match like this ! if he s satan s student , then i don t need to pull any punches ! money ice money ice here goes ! how could you be satan s student ? ice money ice money money ice money b boss ! boss ! shake it off ! ice ! here ! i brought you money ! ice ice wait , sir ! your change ! your change ! aw , how annoying already ! you still need something ? no"
"i don t care if he s majin boo , or pee , or whatever , once he takes this , he s done for ! b boss , boss ! what is it ! ? what a nuisance ! that"
"you don t think ? there s one missing ! ah , is that where it is ? all right w what s the matter ! ? i was just trying to return it to the nest , you know ! there ! but if the egg hatches in a place like this , the child is going to fall off the cliff ! he went to see some eggs , you say ? why does he have to go see those dinosaur eggs again at a time like this ! ? he said they looked like they were going to hatch today , so he was just going to go see how they were doing"
"shall i go look over on the other side of the mountain ? i ve had it ! we re goin with just us ! good grief , that goku sa is never around at important times like this ! he s always gettin himself left behind ! it s not my fault if he whines about it later ! really , at times like this ! i don t think that reinforcing it that way is going to hold"
"gramps hey , hey , hey ! sorry , but if you re going to fight , could you do it over there ? all right , fight ! let s dance ! gohan , dance your heart out ! what are you doin , gohan ! ? i ll show you the secret to how it s done ! awesome , awesome ! goten , your mom is incredibly cool , huh ? big brother , did you know ? mm hmm i knew that mother was a master of the eternal turtle style , but this is the first time i ve ever seen her do it"
i wonder if son kun isn t going to come after all
"what , you guys were worried and came to watch too ? i d like to relocate that egg to a safer place , but it s gotten so weak , that if i move it at all , it looks like it might break"
"where s chichi ? i m right here ! what do you mean by moseyin on in here now ? everyone s gettin ready to leave ! yeah , i meant to come right back , but you see forgive me ! well , it s not like this is the first time , huh ? if i were to get upset over every little thing , i could never be goku sa s wife , could i ? have you eaten yet ? no , not yet"
"papa and them are here too ? good grief , would you look at this father and son ? geez , you re not showing any mercy , father ! it s been a while , huh bulma , vegeta ? it hasn t been just a while ! i mean , really ! if we were to leave you alone , you d never come to see us , would you ? you ve been that way since long ago"
"that ain t so ! we just saw you a mere five years ago , didn t we ? that s five years ! five years ! everyone else got together , but you said you had to train , and couldn t come , right ? t that s true , but w what ! ? you ve become a total auntie , huh ? hush , you ! even looking like this , people often say ma am , you re so young ! you saiyans are monsters for never changing at all ! we saiyans are a warrior race"
"vegeta , you enter too ! why ? why , all of a sudden , have you decided to enter this tournament in particular ? because there s going to be someone else that appears to be strong entering too"
"if you re too strong , there won t be any more challengers next time , after all ! i know , i know"
"oh ! well if it isn t goku san ! good day , grandpa"
"it s been a while ! what s this ! ? don t worry ! if one of us wins through , we ll let you have the victory"
"not again , not again ! there s no way that something like that could happen , is there ? say , satan san , everyone else has come to the stadium , but there aren t any seats left , so they said they wanted you to do something"
"is that right , is that right ? something like that is an easy matter to handle ! just leave that to me ! huh ? what s with those guys ? w what is this ? hold on , is he serious ? s sure enough , we ll be able to see well enough from here , but we re not on display ! i if i d known it was going to be like this , i would have entered"
"damn you this is for yamucha ! why , you ! i incredible ! you dirty brat ! i don t even have to dodge this one ! w what ! ? h he defused it with just a kiai shout ! ? d d dammit ! this is for tenshinhan ! how ! ? how does kakarrot have this much power ! ? what ! ? and this is for piccolo ! dammit ! awesome ! you really are awesome , goku ! yeah ! dammit ! dammit ! dammit ! i see impressive , you really are extremely tough , huh ? i am an elite warrior from a distinguished family ! i m not about to be looked down upon by a lower class warrior like you ! you ll pay for this ! i ll kill you ! you miserable fool ! cool that head of yours ! if you ll compose yourself and think about it , you ll find he s not the kind of opponent that you can t take , nappa ! calm down ! you re right ! thanks to you , my eyes have been opened"
"g goku father son kun , pound that guy into a pulpy mass ! h hey ! hey ! don t be so rough with this ! who cares if a crystal ball or two gets broken ! ? it s an important tool of my trade ! with kami sama dead , and us not knowing whether the earth will be destroyed or not , you can just stuff your trade ! how dare you say that ! now see here ! would you two quit it ! ? it doesn t matter , does it ? yeah ! while you two are at it there , goku could be getting done in"
"rubbish ! son kun is obviously doing all right ! you think he s going to lose to those guys ! ? no way ! no way ! don t hit my crystal ball ! hey , shut up , already ! give that here ! a little brother does not take his older sister s things ! i see you ! whoo ! this is a lot better , ain t it ? this is a lot better , huh ? i m going to put a stop to that irritatingly smart mouth of yours ! you re finished now ! what kind of guy is this ! ? he countered at that close range ! that would have been trouble if i d taken that one head on"
"if you do it right , your speed , power , destructive and defensive forces all increase many times over"
"if you have something like that up your sleeve , then use it right at the start ! sorry , but i can t do that"
"if i don t restrain my ki just right while i m controlling it , i could wreck myself"
"if you mishandle your control , you will end up ruining your body"
"t that is , if you re able to beat him , goku"
"so then , contestants , when i call your name , please draw your number ! let s see , first up is son goten san ! right ! this way , if you please ! say , boo can you be sneaky and change the numbers with your magic for me ? when mister satan was still drawing numbers , he asked you to cheat for him , right ? now i m asking"
"why didn t you enter ? you knew that there was going to be this level of guys here from the start , didn t you ? if you had finished , we could have gotten some prize money , you know , prize money"
"let s see , this one ! right ! number one ! contestant pan is number one ! oh ! pan chan is number one , huh ? which means , her opponent is mo kekko w what s this ! ? of all people , it s that ferocious guy ! ? number one , number one , number one okay , next is son goku san ! if you would ! i ve been waiting for this ! which one is open ? all right ! boo , number three , please ! gotcha"
"even his name , see ? it s oob , right ? if you read that backwards , it s boo , ain t it ? right ? that s a strange coincidence , huh ? c can it be ? h he s what ! ? m maybe mom was right after all"
"even if i am the strongest in the village , the world is a big place"
"now then , right off , let s begin the first match ! okay , come back soon ! i ll be right back ! the first match is between contestant pan and contestant mo kekko ! contestant pan is won t you be surprised to hear this a gifted little girl , who is only four years old ! however , as if that weren t enough , amazingly she is also mister satan s granddaughter ! she faces contestant mo kekko , who was unfortunate enough to be defeated by contestant mister boo in the semifinals at the last tournament"
"he is a powerful contender , standing two meters , centimeters ! how cute ! good luck ! don t you pick on her , mo ! she s satan s granddaughter , then ? e even so , that doesn t change the fact that this is making a laughingstock of me ! damn it all ! still , how did that little squirt get through the preliminaries ? even if she is mister satan s granddaughter beats me"
"all right , if it comes to that hey there , you ! come at me ! you little hick ! earlier , you were pretending in front of everyone to be a good little boy , but you re really an incredible brat , ain t you ? and i let s see i hate you ! i m going to knock you flying ! or would you rather , um , get killed , and go back home as a pile of bones ! ? let s see , let s see your mommy s belly button sticks out ! m my mommy s belly button does not stick out ! well then , she s just a pile of poo ! yeah ! yeah ! she s a pile of poo ! what are they up to ? all they re doing is talking out there"
"all righty ! come on ! what sort of guys are those ! ? you d better back out too ! if you don t want to die , that is ! where are you going ? knock san , are you still going to participate ? yeah i was only going to the restroom"
"if i hadn t done so , it didn t seem like you would have gotten serious with me"
"besides from now on , if the time comes when there s some emergency , you re the only one who will be there to protect the peace ! wait there a second ! f father ! guess what ? i m going to go live together with him at his place so that i can train him"
"but what s more even a left behind might be able to overcome an elite , if he tries desperately enough"
"i ll show you ! kaio ken ! ! if that s the limit of what you ve got , then i ll be greatly disappointed ! what a powerful bastard ! and yet , even though i m in this kind of trouble , i m starting to get excited"
"what s the matter ? this is because you got violent with it ! what , are you blaming someone else ! ? well it s the truth ! no , no , that s not why , sis"
"i know ! if i use that thing , i can tell ! how about it ? there are two large readings to the west"
"what a ki ! it s as if the whole earth is shaking ! as before , images from the site of battle have been completely broken off"
"a as of now , there is no way for us to be able to conceive what is happening , or indeed if it has all ended"
"what will become of the earth ! ? now then , changing the schedule a little , what will become of the earth ! ? we now join this discussion of what will become of the earth , and what is left for us ? they ultimately don t know anything , do they ? hey , if you re going to sleep , go sleep at home"
"hey , are you all right ? b by the way , do you have a place to stay ? if you like i can hear it"
"even if i wreck my body , it s better than dying"
"hmm ? what is he planning to do ? no ! your body won t be able to bear it if you go higher than x , goku ! times three kaio ken ! ! what ! ? a awesome ! why , you ! w why , you ! h he can do this ! he just might be able to beat him ! goku s fightin power readin has risen , you say ? what on earth is goin on ? baba san , please hurry up and show us how the fight is going ! how is gohan ? how is gohan ! ? i it s no use ! the ki over there is too strong , and i can t control the power ! you don t suppose goku has unleashed some technique he s been saving , do you ? sure ! if that s the case , then h he just might win ! i , on the other hand , have a bad feeling about this"
"if i don t finish this quickly damn ! my body can t ! what re you doin , goku ! ? you should just put him away right here n now ! h how can i let this happen ! ? i am super elite ! there s no way i should be beaten by that lower class warrior ! i i am i am the greatest in the universe ! my whole body is aching ! sure enough , it looks like performing a times three kaio ken was asking too much lf i dally around , i ll be the one who goes down first ! blood ? i had my noble blood shed over fighting a piece of trash like that ? this will not stand ! this absolutely absolutely will not stand ! ! i don t need this planet anymore ! i m going to crush you , along with the rest of the earth ! you re going to what ! ? go ahead and try to dodge this , if you can ! even if you spare yourself , the earth will be blown to pieces ! dammit , he thought this through ! i ain t got no choice but to risk it ! times three kaio ken kamehame ha ! ! ka me ha there s absolutely no way you can stop my gyallic ho blast ! me let you and the earth together turn to space dust ! damn it , man ! if i hafta die like this , i should ve eaten more meaty buns ! ha ! ! w what ! ? it s just like my gyallic ho ! yow , that s hot ! what is this ? t the power of the ki from goku and that other guy is manifesting itself through the crystal ball ! kaio ken times four ! ! no ! goku ! h he s pushing back m my body ! h he did it he did it ! son ! you did it , didn cha ! ? you bastard ! yajirobe ? what are you doing here ? what , you hadn t noticed ? for someone as good as you are , ya sure fought desperately , huh ? i guess so"
"if that s all it would have taken for him to die , there wouldn t be any challenge"
"even if the saiyan doesn t turn into a great ape , it doesn t change the fact that he s still in a pinch"
"am i going to be able to mentally focus myself for that ? kakarrot you might have thought you could outwit me by getting rid of the moon , but it won t work ! the moon ? what are you talking about ? as if you didn t know ! are you aware of why we can transform during a full moon ? transform ? the light from the moon is what gets reflected from the sun"
"things are not going to go as you expected ! even if you have eliminated the moon , by mixing this planet s oxygen with my power ball sorry to keep you waiting , kakarrot"
"he s going to die if this keeps up what are you talking about , gohan ? there s no way goku your father is going to die , is there ? besides , even if we go back there , we can t do anything against a guy with a ki that incredible"
"what the hell has happened ? i impossible ! you mean the saiyan has transformed , even without the moon ! ? it s hopeless now ! there s no way he can stand up to that monster ! what about gohan chan ! ? what s gohan chan doin ! ? where s gohan chan ! ? there s someone else there it s yajirobe ! what is he doing ! ? come on , yajirobe ! why aren t you helping son kun ! ? hey ! g gohan chan chichi ! father ! goku , he s your son , all right"
"what s the matter , kakarrot ? can t you manage anything ! ? h he s so fast for as big as he is ! i don t have enough time to mentally focus so i can create a genki dama ! and even if i went to a x kaio ken , it wouldn t be any use against him ! hmph"
"if you re not going to come at me , then i m coming after you ! i i just need ten seconds ! i need some time to concentrate ! t that s it ! tenshinhan , i m going to borrow your technique ! taiyo ken ! ! now , while his eyes are blinded by the glare ! m my eyes ! my eyes ! all right at this distance t the land the seas and all living things each of you , share with me just a little bit of your genki energy ! l beg you ! dammit , that was an insolent stunt ! j just a little longer just a little more , and i can form a genki dama w what s he doin ? he s starting to get his sight back"
"this is the end for you , kakarrot ! even if you were to come back to life again , this planet won t be here when you do ! d damn i m utterly defeated i never imagined there d be this much difference in our power i m glad there was someone so strong but if i die it d be so frustrating die ! ! that s what you call the weasel s last fart now , i ain t even got enough strength left to blow my nose d do as you like w why , you ! kakarrot ! how dare you how dare you scar my face ! ? i m going to squeeze you to death ! having been wounded , vegeta was burning with anger"
"but if we cut off his tail , he ll return to normal"
if it isn t kakarrot s kid
"you guys were mistaken to have challenged me to battle ! dammit ! if we don t do something stop stop ! stop ! stop ! stop ! so , you want to die ahead of your father , do you ? t this is bad ! what s the matter ? too scared to move ? dammit ! i didn t know there was yet another one ! my tail ! h he did it ! i got nothin to do with this i i got nothin to do with this from here on i it s gone ! his tail is gone ! you did it , yajirobe ! he returned to his original form ! lt s not my problem whatever happens now , it s not my problem w why , you ! you want to die so badly that you ve made me angry ! ? w what s going on ? why did that monster ? in that case , as you wish , i will kill you , you miserable scum ! there , ya see ? gohan ! get out of there ! i ll start with you"
"finally , i ll kill the bastard who cut off my precious tail ! he remembered me , huh ? you don t have to beat him just keep him bottled up your power should be even more incredible than his even more while you re doing that , i ll have kuririn finish him off i can t ! i can t even move anymore ! you stupid jackass ! do you want everyone else s deaths to be in vain ? what did piccolo teach you ? i m counting on you , gohan for left behind scum , you re sure giving me a lot of trouble ! g gohan ! what s the matter ! ? eh ! ? s stop that die ! stop that ! what s the matter ? die ! die ! stop that ! ! what ! ? i m going to defeat you ! you are going to defeat me ? what the ! ? kuririn ! kuririn , please ! come here ! d dammit don t you mess around with vegeta sama ! g goku , it s hopeless"
"bulma san , thank you ! if i were to ever have a husband and son who were in trouble , i would rush to their side , no matter what"
"y you guys dare to make me , vegeta sama , use up nearly all of my power ? never mind that you ganged up on me , against trash like you , it wounds my pride would you die , already ! ? d dammit dammit ! g goku ! damn it ! coming from me , that destructive force was pathetic ! all three of them are still barely alive ! i i ve taken more damage than i thought i i have to put them all away quickly and then recuperate t this brat has re grown his tail ! h his tail ? that s right in the past , goku s tail suddenly grew back , too if he were to transform , that would be a problem ! gohan s tail has once again grown out"
"h his tail ? that s right in the past , goku s tail suddenly grew back , too if he were to transform , that would be a problem ! what ! ? i got him ! i got him ! t take that , you jackass ! ha ha ha on you ! how dya like that ! ? ain t no way yer a match for yajirobe sama ! nyaah ! w why , you ! you filthy bastard ! s s sorry bout that ! did it hurt ? i was just jokin around"
"did i cut ya ? that s right ! i got lotsa respect for ya ! lemme be your friend y yajirobe nobody inflicts a wound on my body and gets away with it ! there s no way you re getting away with that ! dammit ! g gohan gohan ! gohan ! t that s father s voice gohan , hear my voice look at the ball of light in the sky b ball of light ? ball of light ? o oh , hell ! you think i m going to allow that ! ? die ! ! oh , no ! you brat ! i m not about to let you grow huge ! i if i don t kill him right now ! gohan ! lt s up to you ! g gohan is becoming a great ape i it s an all or nothing gamble t that s right ! his tail ! in my panic , i forgot the most important thing ! if i can just cut off his tail ! g gohan b but when goku turned great ape , he lost virtually all of his rationality ! what about gohan ? gohan is the same ! t that makes sense"
"no , not the root of evil die ! ! wait ! g goku ? goku , was that you who just spoke into my mind ? yeah , it was i can t talk very loud , and all k kuririn , forgive me , but let him get away let him what ? a are you crazy ? p please t this is the only thing l ll ever ask for myself but goku , this is the guy that killed our friends , and tried to kill everyone else in the world ! if we let him go now , he s certain to recover his strength , and come back here ! y you re probably right if you re thinking that maybe he ll have a change of heart , the way piccolo did , then you re greatly mistaken ! he s not that kind of guy ! l know that and i know that vegeta there has incredible strength s still i ain t able to say this too well but when i saw him nearly dead there , i thought to myself what a waste"
"b bulma san , yamucha was except for the four of us , everyone else was done in uh huh , we saw it on tv"
if only piccolo had been one of the survivors well scuse me for livin
"that s right ! all you did was run away ! you didn t fight one bit ! what did you say ! ? a good for nothing like you should have died right off , instead of piccolo ! you idiot ! if i hadn a been there , these guys wouldn a survived ! this is pissin me off ! i m sick of bein good ! all right , all right"
we have to load up everyone else s bodies
"if we go to planet namek , the home world of that namekian , i m sure that there will be dragon balls that are even more powerful"
"if and that s a really big if we were able to go to this planet namek place , we might be able to obtain their dragon balls"
"if you did that , you would be able to bring those who had died back to life"
"piccolo san could come back to life ! g gohan chan , how can you say that ! ? that s right ! if piccolo came back to life , so would kami sama ! and that means we could restore the dragon balls here , too ! banzai ! banzai ! t that s incredible ! then there s a chance there really is a chance ! isn t there ? isn t there ? isn t there ? you amateurs make it sound so nice and simple"
"whatever else you may say , i am a kaio , after all"
"this gentleman is kaio sama , is he ? kaio sama , it looks like everyone else can hear you , too , so tell us"
"yeah , but dragon balls can grant any wish , right ? if they re the guys that could make them things , they coulda just wished to have the abnormal weather stopped , right ? that probably wouldn t have worked"
"that s where you re being completely naive , i tell you ! if you used a spaceship with the world s most powerful engine , an experimental model my dad made , i calculated how much time it would take you to reach planet namek"
"it would take you d have to live to a ripe old age , huh ? k kaio sama , what should we do ? y y you re asking me ? if that s the problem , i think we ll be all right"
"t that s right ! and there s the one that my brother raditz came in , too ! come to think of it , that one got destroyed by gohan but anyhow , there s still one of them , right ? if i can find that one and analyze it , i just might come up with something"
"mm hmm , that is , if we can get to planet namek"
"bulma san ! me ! ? well , bulma san , nobody else would know if it s a spaceship"
"thought what if , came here searching , and this here"
"if this really is a spaceship , then your story earlier would indeed be consistent"
"this has to be a spaceship ! but even if that s so , can we use it or not ? the door moved , so it has to have power , right ? is this the main switch ? nope"
i wonder if there s a code number or something
"if it worked as easily as that , then when kami sama was a child , he would have tried pushing them , too"
i wonder if bulma san will really find anything for us
he shouldn t even be able to walk properly yet what if he breaks a bone ! ? she s making too much of it
"if anything were to happen , you re the only one familiar with the mechanics , bulma san"
"u um what s the matter ? have to go potty ? p please take me , too ! g gohan chan ! w what kind of silly joke is that ? it s not a joke ! i i really want to go d don t be absurd ! it ll take two more months , on top of everythin else ! i m sorry"
"what kind of nonsense are you two talkin ! ? there s no reason for gohan chan to be doin any of this ! what if anythin were to happen ! ? for cryin out loud , he hasn t even healed enough ! we d better stand back"
"yow ! ! you don t need to bother oh , no ! if you say that , girls aren t goin to like you"
"if you can hit that hard , you ll be fine , gohan"
"so this is the spaceship , huh ? it s somethin else ! okay , gohan chan , make sure you re careful as you go"
"whatever else you might say , this is the first time man is goin to outer space"
"of all the doctor ! how many times must i say it before it gets through to you ? if you keep doing that , you ll never get to go home"
"do you think that maybe vegeta went to one of those aliens planets to get treated ? if he did , then when he comes back to earth would depend on where that planet was"
"if it were far away , then it would buy us some time"
"suppose vegeta were to suddenly appear from over there c cut that out ! look , i m starting to get goosebumps ! i wonder if that man vegeta is recovering from his injuries somewhere right now"
i d appreciate it if he d just die
"y yeah w we have to kill them , huh ? w what s happening ! ? zeshin ! bad news ! we ve gone into a meteor swarm ! what ! ? damn hey , keep an eye on these guys ! if they try anything funny , shoot them right there ! kuririn ! now s our chance ! save me , quickly ! y yeah"
"chichi and stickum what are you doing ! ? hurry it up ! right but any ship that goes into a meteor swarm like this won t last long , no matter how tough it is ! if we don t hurry , we won t be spared , either ! but that s why we can t just leave these needy people like this who are you calling needy people ! ? are you okay ? all right ! w who are these guys ? somebody help ! oh , no ! take care of things here ! geez , you two are just too nice to others hey ! what kind of piloting is that ! ? which one is ? damn ! i can t stand to watch this ! move it ! what are you doing ! ? let me do this"
"why , zeshin ! ? these guys are freeza s men ! their pals are the ones who killed our moms and dads ! if they were freeza s men , they wouldn t have saved us"
"if you go straight in the direction ks , there should be quite a shortcut"
"if it weren t for me taking the proper measures , all three of you would have croaked"
"if you go out in that toy like thing , you ll get yourself stomped on easily"
"is that for me ? this ? if you can put it on , you can wear it"
"their faces are completely different from the way they look now , aren t they ? yeah , it would seem so w what are these ? i wonder if there s treasure in them"
"a are you all right ? i m fine , but the radar c could you hand that over ? hey ! hold it ! bulma san ! hey ! hold it ! telling him that isn t going to get through to him ! wait ! what are you doing ! ? y you can t go any farther ! we have to hurry , or he ll get away , you know ! why are you stopping me ! ? let me go ! if you go any farther , your life will be in danger"
"if he s ended up like that , that means the dragon ball is in the swamp , right ? how are we going to get it out of there ? oh , that would be impossible"
"under any circumstances ? well , i do have a bodysuit for that sort of thing , but even if you were to wear it to dive down there , it would only be good for ten seconds"
"what if we tied a special rope around his body , to pull him up before ten seconds is up ? mm hmm , that sounds good"
"all right kienzan ! ! masenko ! ! stop that ! if you do that , you re going to destroy the dragon ball ! b but what are you doing ! ? clumsy , clumsy , clumsy ! stay away ! stay away ! stay away ! this is why i said i didn t want to come to planet namek ! bulma san ! this is why i said i couldn t go from the start , you know ! there s no way a delicate young lady like myself can go looking for dragon balls ! you re not serious ! without that dragon ball , piccolo san won t be coming back to life"
"y you re kidding , right ! ? if we don t act fast , we re going to become bird food"
"okay , bulma san , you keep a lookout , if you please"
"no , he s not gettin away with it ! makin others worry about him like this if he doesn t get back here soon , i m goin to turn this sweater into hankies ! you won t get away from me ! bulma san , are you sure this toy can fly ? you just hush ! if i say it will fly , then it will fly ! i told you , we should have run away down the stairs"
"all right , gohan , let s go ! right ! hold it , hold it , hold it ! oh , man ! enough , already ! i did it ! i really am a mechanical genius ! amazing ! kienzan ! ! masenko ! ! we got him ! we re saved ! for goodness sake , you guys are nothing but trouble for me ! if i weren t around , we wouldn t have gotten a single dragon ball"
"if we melt it too fast , this whole cave could collapse"
"i get it ! i get it already , so just hurry it up ! ah , man ! i m sure this cold is no good for my skin ! if my beauty is ruined because of this , it would be a serious loss for the universe , wouldn t it , zarkuro san ? huh ? where could he have gone ? bulma san , just a little more"
"we did it ! the sixth one ! one more to go ! hooray ! hooray ! hooray ! hooray ! what ? what is this ! ? i thought you were going to keep this from happening ! if you re going to complain , tell us later ! let s just hurry ! kuririn , do something , quick ! wah ! oh no ! left ! left ! go left ! all right ! ho , ho , not bad"
"it would be a relief if lychee san or zarkuro san were here , huh ? what are you worrying about ? this one out here is going to be a simple affair compared to the others , isn t it ? i don t see you going out to get it"
he can t complain about it if he s not here
"that bastard ! hey ! vegeta ! vegeta sama ! give me that ! it turns out i need it after all ! vegeta ! i won t let you do this ! those belong to me ! w what are you doing ? if you try anything perverted , you re going to answer for it ! we re through playing around now"
he ll be eaten if you leave him there
you ll wait until someone else comes down on this planet
"okay , let s take off ! open the door ! hey what s the matter ! ? open the door ! all right ! they don t know how to open the door , do they ? how are you coming , gohan ? no good ! they re squirming all over , and i m getting nowhere ! kuririn san ! d darn it ! all right , now ! kuririn san all right what is this ? if we don t hurry it up , the fog is going to lift ! why didn t you make sure to look into this ? shut up ! we just need to bring the girl with us , right ? huh ? ah , h hold on we did it ! yahoo ! come on , open it ! we can t afford to dally around ! once the opening in the cosmic tidal currents closes , there s no telling when it will open again ! l listen , let s all go together , like friends"
"huh ? years ! ? hurry it up ! hurry , or else ! a all right"
"there is food to eat , if you re not too fussy"
"d damn it , if that s how it s going to be oh , wow , they re weaker than i thought"
"if it weren t for you , we wouldn t have known how to get out of here"
i d send him some if there were a delivery service
"wasn t that prudent of me ? we ll be lucky enough if there s some level of oxygen here , but i also prepared some atmospheric masks , though that will limit our time out there to roughly this looks sort of like the place where i trained with piccolo san"
"please look ! i m reading them ! hooray ! now we can finally what are you doing ? oh , i was wondering if we weren t being tricked again , so just to make sure it s for real , i tell you ! yow ! all right ! hooray ! hooray , hooray ! hooray , hooray , hooray ! kuririn san , there s a strong ki coming from over there"
"if that guy gets the dragon balls , it s over"
"a little more than two months , right ? freeza , you bastard ! i won t let you snatch them away from me ! i should be able to handle everyone besides freeza , but i don t stand a chance of winning if i fight him head to head"
"what should we do , gohan ? s should we go back to earth now , too ? after all , it looks like we ve got one more foe now , and even if we do have the dragon radar oh , i mean , i m fine and all , but it wouldn t be right if anything were to happen to gohan"
"b but kuririn san , if we do that , then he ll get the dragon balls"
"well , if we yield the dragon balls to him this time , we could always use them next time"
we won t get to have any fun if they run away
"all right , just a little more goku sa chichi what are you doin ? oh , you know , i was bored , so really how about you realize somewhat that you were seriously injured ? if you don t lie there quietly , you re goin to open your wounds up again"
"ow ! yow ow ow ow ! don t be so rough ! yow ow ow ow ! that hurts ! that hurts ! never mind that , i wonder if gohan chan is okay"
"what s his rating ? t this is absurd could my newer model be malfunctioning , too ? he s gone up to , if he s at , are you saying that his battle power is even higher than ours ? i it couldn t be"
"if the two of you fight together , it is a rating that you can sufficiently beat , is it not ? vegeta probably wants to obtain eternal life with the dragon balls , the same wish that i have"
"t that doesn t sound bad , does it ? if you team up with me at that battle power , i think we could somehow manage zarbon and dodoria"
"even if i were careless enough to get too close to them , l might be able to take zarbon or dodoria , but there s still no way l can beat freeza"
it would be nice if they had the fifth dragon ball
i wonder if they ll really be okay
"if i don t start training soon , my body is going to go soft"
"if the earth had been lost , i wouldn t have been able to eat any of it"
i wonder if i busted it when i was a kid
"as you ordered , it can generate at most gs worth of gravity , but even for you , isn t that a bit reckless ? at gs , after all , if you weigh that s six tons"
"if i don t train someplace like that , i won t be able to beat that saiyan"
i wonder if he s really okay with the stereo close we re close
"though if so , i don t see vegeta around"
"is he off somewhere else , looking for dragon balls ? my name is freeza , and as you can see , i am gathering your so called dragon balls"
"but i can t take this ! still , you want to bring piccolo and everyone else back to life , right ? that s not the sort of opponent that we can stand up against"
"if we come forward now , we d just die for nothing"
"i would not turn over the dragon ball to the likes of you , even if it meant my own death ! so you mean that you would choose death over handing it over to me ? i see"
"don t be ridiculous ! we namekians don t sell each other out , even if it means our own lives ! now , we had an agreement ! leave here at once ! oh dear , not you , too"
"i guess i will have to have you die along with the children ! w what did you say ! ? why , you ! elder ! elder ! this isn t what we agreed to ! you promised you wouldn t do anything else if i handed over the dragon ball ! but unless i have all seven dragon balls , it is meaningless , correct ? you have destroyed our scouters , so we will need to have you tell us where the remaining two are"
"damn it ! after them ! dodoria san , catch them ! gohan , fly as fast as you can ! if he catches us , we re finished ! right ! fools ! do you think you can escape ? it s no good ! he s faster than us ! he ll overtake us ! they are quite fast , aren t they , freeza sama ? they also seem to have more battle power than the namekians"
"that mountain is in the way , you see ? now our visibility has become much clearer , has it not ? huh ? gohan ! oh , crap ! damn ! dammit , let go of me ! let go of me , you ! i m not going to make it in time ! gohan ! get out of here ! hurry ! he s coming ! damn , these sure are nimble little guys ! kuririn san , let s land and fight him ! we can t ! he isn t the sort of foe we can do anything against by fighting ! just fly as hard as you can ! damn , if this keeps up , we ve had it ! i ve got to do something ! that s it ! gohan ! gohan , from here on , don t look in my direction ! close your eyes ! i have an idea"
"if he still had one , he d be able to locate even that little kid s ki , after all"
"but if you hadn t helped , kuririn san , both of us would be dead"
"there are dragon balls here , but there are these strange guys gathering them all up , occupied by bulma chan ! do not open ! do not touch ! there are dragon balls here , but there are these strange guys gathering them all up , and if they make off with all of them like this , then it doesn t make any sense why a delicate young lady like myself has risked all of this danger to come to this planet , does it ? am i right ? hey , are you listening to me , dad ! ? yeah , l m listening to every word"
"won t it be a shame if you two miss each other ? son kun ? son kun is coming here to planet namek ? really , really , really he is ? yeah , that s right"
"if you do so , i ll let you slide this one time"
"now , if you re lucky , you just might at least have your life spared"
"and if they were here , the first thing i would do is go dispose of them"
"die , and come back next time as a harder worker ! wait , vegeta ! if you let me go now , i ll let you in on a secret ! i it s about your world , planet vegeta ! what ? did you say planet vegeta ? what secret is there about planet vegeta ! ? let go ! let go of me , and i ll tell you ! y you re not planning to kill me right after i tell you , are you ? if you don t tell me , i ll kill you right now ! start talking ! y you saiyans planet vegeta wasn t wiped out when a giant meteor struck it , like freeza sama said"
"what ! ? individually , the saiyans powers were a far cry from freeza sama s , but if a large number of saiyans were to unite together , it would become fairly troublesome"
"what s that ! ? something is coming ! it s incredibly fast ! hide ! quickly ! right ! we ll be found if we stay here , won t we ? never mind , just hurry up and suppress your ki ! all we can do now is leave our fate up to heaven"
"and yet , how is it that he can tell where we are ? d don t tell me he has the ability to sense ki ! if that s the case , then this is bad"
"if you keep going the way you are , you re going to collide with the star alpha hz at xy"
"if i raise the gs even more , i ll become even stronger ! i feel it ! larger size powers ! they number about twenty"
"uh , who exactly are you people ? kuririn san , is that ? what s gotten into you all of a sudden ? is someone else coming ? n no , it s not that"
"i m not sure whether vegeta and that freeza bastard are on the same side or not , but if either one of them gains eternal life with the dragon balls , it will be the end of the world"
"if we are able to find and hide even one of the dragon balls , they won t be able to get all seven together"
"w we can t ! if we were to do that , then they would keep searching until they had killed all of the namekians ! o oh , no it s appalling , no matter which way it turns out"
damn ! if only i had finished vegeta off back then ! please tell me about yourselves
"w where have you come from ? how do you know about the dragon balls ? p please save everyone else on the planet ! w why , you ! how could you do this ! ? no matter what happens , you have no intention of handing over the dragon ball , do you ? i i m not about to hand it over to the likes of you ! you are one interminably stubborn old geezer"
"now then , for this thing if i submerge the dragon ball here , no one will be able to find it"
"if that fool cannot catch those kids , then let him be"
"if we search the remaining villages , they are sure to have the dragon balls"
"if you find a village , do nothing , and come inform me"
"if there are any strong namekians there , they would probably be too much for you"
"and if he has , he ought to be coming for our dragon balls"
"if things go right when our wish is granted , the dragon balls on earth will be revived as well"
"if that s the case , then there are hardly any namekians left on this world"
"if he searches for ki , he ll arrive at the grand elder s place before long , and he ll take the seventh dragon ball from him ! t then we have to hurry and go tell the grand elder about this ! please ! please ! whether it s freeza or vegeta , if either one of them is given eternal life , it will be terrible ! a all right , let s hurry"
"ah , if l m starting to hope for miracles , then we ve had it"
"planet namek , right ? it would be nice if you could find their dragon balls , huh ? what s with you , kaio sama ! ? don t you know anything ? there s something terrible happening on planet namek"
"it s chaozu , if you can believe that"
"if you launch some shoddy attack on freeza and get him angry , something terrible is going to happen"
"if you re planning to fight freeza , i cannot teach you"
"even if he has told me not to mess with him , there s no harm in getting stronger ! all right , let s try jumping all the way to times gravity ! hey , if we keep flying at this pace , how long before we arrive at the grand elder s place ? we should be able to make it in another five hours"
"goku ! ? lt took him three weeks ? question ! what is it ? if we catch that monkey , will you train us , kaio sama ? that s wishful thinking"
i don t remember giving you permission to participate in the training ! hmph ! i don t wish to undertake any training under you if it undermines my own dignity
"under take any training under me if it under mines your dignity you made a triple , did you ? piccolo , you passed the test"
"hey , hey , hey , hey , what are you all standing around for ? laugh ! laugh ! that was funny ! that was funny , right ? if only i had a scouter , a village would be easy to find"
he deflected it ! incredible ! it s a clash of ki against ki ! vegeta and someone else are banging into each other ! h his opponent is probably the one who was at that freeza guy s side
"all right hold on to me tight ! this is our chance ! we ll hurry to the grand elder while the two of them are fighting each other ! if i fly as fast as i can , we ll get there a lot sooner ! let s go ! what s the matter ! ? zarbon sama , of all people ! your movements make you look like you re standing still ! damn it ! to think that you d be so helpless at this level ! you ve surprised me"
i wonder if tenshinhan and those guys are training under kaio sama
"if i m forced to stay cooped up in a place like this for too long , i ll go crazy ! i wonder if kuririn san has found that grand elder person"
"um , if he already knows what is generally going on , why hasn t he left this unsafe location ? grand elder sama has grown too aged"
"grand elder sama , if these people s friends come back to life , they may be able to defeat those bad people"
"if he had become one , as he was before , he may not have had to die"
if you d be so kind
"i it won t shorten your life if you do it too much , will it ? all i do is provide the occasion"
"what are we to do if vegeta has hidden a dragon ball from us somewhere ? i i am terribly sorry ! i will go check on him at once ! freeza sama ! i have i have discovered a village ! what ? however , the village had already been destroyed"
be prepared to answer to me as well if vegeta is dead
"lt would be problematic if one were to become a super saiyan , after all"
l wonder if it s the same training that i did
"by the way , if you re not doing anything , would you like to pull weeds with me ? why are you in such a hurry to grow stronger ? you promised me that you had given up on defeating freeza , didn t you ? for shame"
"huh ? are you leaving ? d damn hey ! let s eat ! son goku was something else , but you guys eat a lot too , huh ? we can t be outdone by goku ! if he ate bowls , then i ll eat ! hey , come on now ! if you don t stop now , you ll eat my portion , too besides , it s pretty good"
"even if he does pull through , i m not sure whether or not he will regain consciousness"
"if he runs away , the walk scores a run , and it s goodbye ! knock it out of here ! m me , run away ! ? you re trying to make a fool of me ! v very well , i ll show you ! it s not going to be that easy ! any time you re ready"
"w why , you ! hit this one , if you can ! not so fast ! forkball ! crack ! w w what was that ! ? when you go out , call out to someone first , and lock everyone else out ! that was a come from behind , bases loaded , say goodbye home run"
"wha ? what ! ? you think i can fight decently against someone who had trouble with a monkey , or some batter ? at your level , even if there were ten of you , you d still be a pushover"
"if you don t regain consciousness , l m the one who freeza sama is going to take it out on , after all"
"then again , even if you do come back to life here , you ll be on your way to hell again by freeza sama s hand soon enough anyhow"
"have you not found him yet , zarbon san ! ? if you disgracefully allow him to escape you like this , i will have you take responsibility with your life"
"you are prepared to answer for this , yes ? if you are unable to bring vegeta back here in one hour y yes , sir ! let s see it s around here"
"there they are ! there they are ! that s magnificent control , if i do say so myself"
"not even vegeta would find it if it s in the lake , huh ? here it is ! here it is , here it is"
"then i will have all seven of the dragon balls ! dammit ! where the hell is vegeta ! ? if only i had a scouter , i could easily detect him ! if it keeps going like this , i ll have to surrender my life to freeza sama"
"t that s easy for you to say huh ? well if it isn t kuririn ! don t startle me like that ! i isn t this dangerous , bulma san ? if you re outside leisurely reading a book , they re going to find you"
"what are you talking about ? if i stay inside that cave all the time , i ll huh ? could that be a dragon ball ? you got it ! native dragon balls are gigantic , huh ? the grand elder was quite understanding"
"w who is that ? judging by his face , i wonder if he isn t a champion of justice t this is the worst once again , a battle to the death was about to begin"
"g goku ! no matter how strong goku san may be , if it takes an hour to get through that magnetic storm , he won t last ! can t you do something ? i m completely like this"
"shut up ! how handsome ! bulma san bulma san , now s our chance ! let s get out of here ! but he said he d kill us if we ran ! he ll kill us even if we don t run ! i won t let you do that ! damn ! he doesn t miss a single thing ! don t you sell me short ! you are prepared to answer for this , yes ? if you are unable to bring vegeta back here in one hour lf this keeps up you ve finally made up your mind , have you ? h he s a villain , all right ! w what was that ! ? he turned into a monster ! what s more , his power shot up like mad ! vegeta , you re the only one who has seen this form twice ! i wonder why it was at the bottom of that lake"
"damn , so that s the reason why vegeta s ki has risen like crazy , huh ? listen , even if your battle power has risen , there s still no way you can beat me after i ve transformed , and can exhibit my true power ! the saiyans are a fighting race ! don t underestimate us ! v vegeta i was only acting under orders from freeza sama let me go please after as much as you ve worked me to the bone , don t you dare go asking for anything for yourself ! i know the two of us could team up if we did we could even beat freeza if i could defeat freeza just by teaming up with you , it wouldn t be very sporting"
"now then i don t know how you did it , but you ve raised your battle power a bit since we were on earth , haven t you ? but you re still not at the level where you can fight me on even terms , are you ? what will it be ? would you be inclined to hand over that dragon ball to me nicely ? i i doubt it will do any good to make any agreements with you , but if i hand this over , do you promise to leave here without any trouble ? a promise , huh ? well , all right"
"if that s how badly you want to live , then hand it over before i change my mind"
"if i hadn t handed it over , we definitely would have gotten killed"
"if i had known this would happen , i should have brought the ginyu special corps from the start , huh ? yes , sir ! c concerning that , according to a message we just received from planet freeza , preparations for the ginyu special corps departure are complete"
"vegeta ! hurry and get out of here ! who s there ! ? come on out ! i know you re there ! if you don t show yourself at once , i m going to blow this whole area away ! h he wouldn t ! what s the matter ! ? huh ! ? all right , i wonder if i had better jump out and fight vegeta"
"y you killed kuririn san didn t you ! ? if you d like me to , i wouldn t mind going back now and killing him for you"
"if you won t tell me , then i ll just have to do this ! what are you talking about ? l ve been telling you , haven t l ? it s there ! it s there ! why don t you get it ! ? it s there , i tell you ! it was a dream , huh ? damn it lf the device that kid was holding really is something that can seek out dragon balls , then i can t be careless about leaving here"
"but if we use any more ki than this , that vegeta bastard will find us , no doubt about it"
"it s not like i have to go in and get it , right ? even in the water like that , it s still right nearby , the same as if it were on shore"
"if i m dead , i won t be able to train worth crap"
"let me go ! please , let me go ! i don t even know vegeta ! even if you take me to freeza , there s nothing i can tell him ! which would mean i m done for"
"it s true ! the dragon balls are amazing things that can grant any wish ! stop talking nonsense ! it isn t nonsense ! if you bring the seven dragon balls together , you could have power beyond even freeza s ! what ? i it s true"
"so , wouldn t it be better if you guys left me alone , and went off to gather the dragon balls ? h hey ! i if you make a wish about wanting to make the universe your own , it could come true ! let s go , buleberry ! sounds interesting"
freeza sama would be thrilled if we brought all seven dragon balls to him
"besides , if what she says is true , then we could become rulers of the universe ! t that s right ! that would be the best thing to do"
"if i can lure those guys in there in there ! in there ! go on in there ! in there , okay ? j just a minute ! what are you doing ! ? this is certain to be the place where i die"
"nice ! i m blinded ! you take it from here , if you please , monster san"
"go ! if we fly at this speed , we ll arrive in an hour"
"i don t know what they re planning , but if i let this opportunity pass , i probably won t have another chance to force the location of the last remaining dragon ball that they have out of them"
"if i take this one with me , then even if that woman does seek this place out with her unusual little device , she won t be able to get all seven"
this is incredible ! what s that ? that mountain where kakarrot s son fled to there s something else there
"it doesn t feel like there s just one i it couldn t be ! no doubt about it ! freeza has called in the ginyu special corps ! damn it all ! you guys , hand over your dragon ball to me , now ! n no way ! we won t do that ! i promise you , once i gain the power of immortality , in no way will i do anything to you ! hurry , or there will be no undoing what will happen ! y you think you can fool us ! ? if we do that , we ll be playing right into your hands ! listen to me closely , you dirty bastards ! this ginyu special corps that freeza has called in has five men , each of which is as strong as me no , probably even stronger ! they re going to use the latest scouters to find me , as well as you guys , and then come kill us at once ! t that can t be true ! can t you sense their power ! ? there s only one path we can take ! the only route we have is to make me immortal , and have me defeat them ! what he s saying might be true"
"well , let s make gohan immortal ! he might have the power , but he s utterly lacking in tactical experience ! b but then if that s the case why the hell did we even come here ! ? the dragon balls can grant you three wishes"
"three ? not just one ? t three ? y you guys ! why do you keep repeating it ! ? snap to it ! who knows if there s going to be enough time ! ? l listen , we really we really can have three wishes granted , right ? come with me ! but we re going to make sure you keep your promise , you got that ! ? wait for me ! damn it ! fly as fast as you can ! it looks like they ve left , huh ? yes"
"but even if it works out , their chances of winning are extremely low"
"you want to help out some , don t you ? but if it s about me , i ll be all right"
"don t go thinking you re on an equal level with us , just because freeza sama has taken a liking to you ! as perfect as freeza sama might be in everything else , there s still one thing that i can t comprehend"
"why don t you hand that over right now , vegeta ? although , even if you do hand it over quietly , we have no intention of turning a blind eye to you"
"hurry and get here ! he may be an infuriating bastard , but if we can get another ally , it will add some to our potential for battle"
"let s see , let s see behind that rock ! he s gone ! over there ! how did they know i was here ! ? s s stop hey , ghurd ! this is disgraceful ! you re going to bring shame upon the ginyu special corps ! ghurd , you dummy ! if you get yourself beaten by those pipsqueaks , i m not going to play with you anymore ! you ll have to take your i i just got a little bit careless ! i m going to put these maggots away right now ! all right , now s our chance ! let s charge him , gohan ! right ! t they re coming again ! all right , if that s how they want it , i ll use my trump card ! what is this ? my body won t move ! it s my paralysis technique ! no matter how hard you struggle , you can t move ! dammit ! i can t move ! what happened to all that energy you had earlier ? looks like ghurd is getting pretty anxious"
"hey , you guys ! i m going to skewer you ! you might be good if i cooked you up and ate you ! yeah , i bet you d like to escape , huh ? what s the matter ? if you don t run away soon , this huge skewer is going to run you through ! f father ! uncle piccolo ! gohan ! g gohan is in danger ! piccolo , are you sensing the ki on faraway planet namek ? still , there s nothing that you can do with your power as it is now , piccolo ! i can t eat with this knife ! taberarenai fu naifu yeah ! can t you move ? you poor things"
"what a freak ! don t you have any techniques with more panache than that ? if not , then it s about time i killed you"
"is that okay ? y you monster ! damn it to think he d be this strong lt s almost as though he s treating me like a toddler lf it keeps going like this , l m going to get killed by him g gohan yes ? i if vegeta gets done in , then it will be our turn to get killed next"
"right ! reacoom eraser gun ! ! vegeta san ! move ! you re in my way ! w who asked you to do that ! ? y you idiot ! if you had time to rescue me , why didn t you attack reacoom ! ? for crying out loud , your softness makes me want to vomit ! the ground s surface has been blown away , and the planet s shape has changed what a terrifying beast ! that sneak attack just now was a pretty good one"
"big fire toe attack ! ! kuririn san ! kuririn san ! kuririn san ! m my bones how can this be ? with just one hit this is what happens to me he s too much i is this allowed ? and after having grand elder san raise my power , too i i m no use at all s shake it off , kuririn san ! kuririn san ! f frankly , we re finished we re powerless against them , and if we run , they ll catch us right away and the dragon balls have been taken from us there s nothing good about this tch ! aw , man i couldn t help myself , and hit him too hard"
"if you would like , shall i dance the dance of joy ? p perhaps you could do that next time"
"even if you do get the dragon balls together , you guys won t be able to get your wish granted anyhow"
"i just had a feeling that if i did that , i would know"
what about gohan chan ! ? how is gohan chan doin ! ? chichi san ls he safe ? tell me he s safe ! i i don t know if he is ! l m the one who wants to know what s going on here
"a super saiyan , who can surpass barriers that even the most gifted warriors cannot it couldn t be that s just a ridiculous fable ! e even if the legend is true , l m the only one who has the potential to become a super saiyan ! okay , are you ready ? ginyu special corps , reacoom mach punch ! ! whoop oop oop oop oop he vanished ! huh ? this can t be he s nowhere"
"but no matter how long this lasts , you can t win if all you ever do is run away"
"all right , if that s how you want it , let me show you my best move"
"grand elder sama wrong ! how many times do i have to tell you ! ? huh ! ? your right leg goes like this ! remember , i m thinking up an ultra fighting pose that s far cooler than anything else up until now"
"i know ! if you can pull this off well , i ll give you this"
"if you want to touch them so badly , then maybe i ll let you"
"if you are able to touch them , even a little bit , i will give you all two caramels each"
"if i have to stay here too long , my skin will be damaged , and my good looks will be ruined ! i want to go home to earth"
"h how did you get behind me ! ? behind me , who prides himself on being the fastest in the universe ! then maybe you re second fastest in the universe , ain t you ? h how can this be ? not only did he repel my crusher ball , he managed to slip behind butta ! lt s as if l m having a bad dream"
"still , you can t win on speed alone ! not if all you re doing is running away ! once you ve worn yourself out running away , you ll lose those sharp reflexes , and then you ll die ! go ahead , dodge me ! c can you see that ? not at all"
"if you plan on fighting him , then brace yourself"
"w what ? how can you tell ! ? if the dragon balls here are the same as the dragon balls on earth , then when shen long appears , the sky is supposed to get dark , right ? but up to now , the sky has remained bright"
i if you please
"hide the dragon balls ! if anything happens to them , you will suffer the wrath of freeza sama ! yes , sir ! hey you guys , this isn t a game ! hurry up ! yes , sir ! there , no one will find them now"
i don t care anymore ! i wonder if son kun has landed yet
it would be great if we could get the dragon balls back from them somehow
"vegeta , you know them pretty well , right ? is there any way to go about it ? weren t you planning to defeat freeza ? i d like to if possible , but first , we have to bring everyone who you killed on earth back to life"
"even if you get such a worthless wish granted , it won t do any good if freeza just comes along and wipes out all of earth soon after , will it ? instead , let me wish myself immortally young"
"t this is bad ! once he finds out how to get his wish granted , he s certain to kill grand elder san and the others ! and if grand elder san dies once i pass away , the dragon balls will also disappear"
"he doesn t know that if grand elder san dies , the dragon balls will be lost too ! w what ? they re here ! you certainly made a mockery of us earlier , huh ? now the commander is here to personally make you suffer the consequences ! how about it , goku ? do you have a chance of winning this time , too ? i won t know until i try"
"if i m able to defeat these guys , i ll join you shortly"
"if i m lucky , the two of them might just take care of each other"
"if that happens , i can t fail ! as soon as i get the password to have my wish granted out of those runts , i ll take care of them , too"
"if you had dared to come off to me like that while we were sizing each other up earlier , i would not have hesitated to knock you off your perch"
"even if that guy s battle power really is around , , then commander ginyu s maximum fighting power is much higher"
"yikes ! geez ! what could everyone else possibly be up to while i m here , struggling by myself like this ? how do i know they haven t all forgotten about me , and are just goofing around now ? good grief , first my spaceship gets all broken , and i can t go back to earth"
"w what was that just now ? a all seven of them are in the same place , aren t they ? i i ll just bet they were going to leave me behind , while they went and made their wish to shen long ! all right ! but suppose the person who has gathered the dragon balls is vegeta , instead ? not again ! w what is it with this planet anyway ? i know ! even if it is vegeta , i can just say , send me back to earth first ! hey , that s simple enough , isn t it ? with that settled , i m off to the dragon balls ! let s go ! all right he s fast ! he might have the edge on speed ! oh , crap ! i managed to bottle you up there pretty good ! dammit ! commander ! he s all ours now ! damn he s got incredible power ! i can t get free ! commander ! you can shatter his bones any time now , and finish him off ! l l m out of options ! at this point , l ll have to use kaio ken wha ? c commander ! who asked you to help , jheese ? c commander ! if you pull anything uncalled for like that again , consider yourself dead ! yes , sir"
i doubt you ll be able to rest in peace if you re killed without using all of your power
"even so if you die , grand elder sama , the dragon balls will also disappear"
"if that happens , then the earthlings wish cannot be granted"
"listen well , and get this through that head of yours ! if you kill grand elder sama , the dragon balls will also disappear ! grand elder ? now i see"
"grand elder san , i do not suppose that you would be of a mind to tell me , would you ? however , you would not refuse to tell me if this gentleman here were about to be killed , would you ? nail will not be as easy to defeat as you may think"
"if you are going to be as stubborn as this , then i will show you the terror of the strongest being in the universe"
"i believe that if this gentleman were about to be killed , you would soon change your mind and tell me how to have the dragon balls grant my wish"
"if you like , we can spare your life right here and now"
"it would be bad for you and i both if we were to fight here , with him caught in the middle"
what ! ? i know ! what if i were to fight using only my left hand for you ? that might make it more enjoyable
"you should not be straining yourself so , should you ? i think it would be best for you if you spoke , before you get killed"
"there wasn t even any warning what have the two of you been up to ? ! no sooner do you show up suddenly with vegeta and take the dragon ball away , then you take off with him to someplace else ! now , i want to know just what s going on ! do you think you can just leave a delicate lady unattended out here in such a dangerous place , and get away with it ? ! b b but didn t we just rescue you from that dinosaur ? b bulma san , at any rate , we need the dragon radar ! if everything works out , we may still be able to get our wish granted ! what s this ? you still haven t gotten our wish granted ? i saw from the radar all seven dragon balls had been gathered in one place"
"on top of that , if i manage to safely get back to earth , l ll probably just get chichi angry at me again"
"and so then , right there , i told him wait , hold on now what s this ? what was that ! ? what s going on ! ? w what was that explosion just now ? ! v v v vegeta ! damn ! hey ! where are the dragon balls ? look at all of you , lined up so loyally ! if you don t want to tell me then you don t have to tell me"
it s no good if they realize i m here
let s hurry and find them ! no one else seems to be here
now piccolo san and everyone else can finally be brought back to life
"kuririn san , someone is coming this way ! hey , i can feel two ki ! is it those two ginyu guys ? if so , does that mean that father was beaten ? things are turning for the worse again ! they re evil ki ! there s no mistake , it has to be those two from before ! w what happened to goku , then ? we ve got to suppress our own ki and take cover , gohan ! right ! the dragon balls have been dug up ! what s going on ? how did anyone know where they were buried ? goku ! it s me , it s me ! you sure surprised me ! i thought , ginyu ! it must be that ginyu guy coming ! i didn t know you had beat him , and convinced his pal to come over to our side"
"what do you think you re doing , goku ? ! it s not father ! that isn t father there ! i if that isn t goku , then what s going on ? he looks just like him ! i don t know , but i can just tell"
"unfamiliar body ? that s right ! if i ain t used to this body , he shouldn t be used to my body , either ! you ve switched bodies ? that s impossible ! i think i ll test it out right now"
"how do you even expect to use its ki well , let alone kaio ken ? if body and mind ain t completely united , you won t get any great power ! your lies won t work on ginyu sama"
"why don t you just give up now ? g give up ? you expect me , ginyu sama to give up ! ? don t be ridiculous ! kuririn gohan for someone such as yourself to even consider picking a fight with me takes a lot of guts ! babble as much as you want ! how did you manage to hide yourself ! ? there wasn t any reading on my scouter ! you guys rely too much on your scouters ! if you were to fight against those guys from earth , you d figure it out for yourself ! that is , assuming you don t die here first ! don t be ridiculous ! the ginyu special corps is made up of only the most super elite warriors in the universe ! there s no way a monkey bastard such as you could ever stand a chance against me ! so you say , but you re actually afraid of my renewed battle power , aren t you ? w what ? take a good , long look , with your precious scouter there"
depart from that planet as quickly as you can ! i if dende can just make it to where they are you namekians really are very stubborn
"t this is bad ! if we allow him to take over vegeta s body now it s all over i ll take that body of yours ! chan what ! ? impressive , vegeta"
"say , gohan , if vegeta feels he needs even our help , it must mean that freeza is awfully strong , huh ? it scares me"
"those are soft enough that if you pull on them , they ll stretch"
"well , if you say so"
"i know that freeza is probably there too , but if we can t get the password to summon shen long , there s nothing we can do anyhow"
thou who hast gathered the seven balls now speak forth the password i wonder if i look any stronger
"i bet if mother or piccolo san were to see me in this outfit , they d be surprised"
"even if you were to find out , by now , it no longer matters"
kuririn san ! gohan san ! i wonder if it really will take kuririn san two whole hours to get to the grand elder san and back
what am i supposed to do if freeza comes back before then ? i hope kuririn san gets back soon
"oh , really ? so , what is it were supposed to say ? the password must be spoken in the namekian language , or else the wish will not be granted"
"the grand elder san isn t very good with people , or else he could have told us that while we were there"
"that way , even if he realizes that shenlong has appeared , well have bought some time"
"only one at a time ! ? if they only have three wishes and there s me , yamcha , chiaotzu , and piccolo all right ! i ll have myself restored to life first"
"quickly ! if we re found out by freeza or vegeta , we re finished ! what do we do ? only one person can be brought back per wish ! this is quite a fix"
"now listen closely ! with the first wish , bring me back to life ! wait ! we won t let you get away with this , piccolo ! you shut up ! don t forget , if i am returned to life , kami will be also"
"why you ! hold it now kaio sama ! just take it easy ! let go of me ! how dare you do this to me ! i don t know what kind of punk you are , but i , piccolo sama , will be sure to defeat you ! you guys ! you have no idea how terrible freeza is ! let go of me ! i can t talk to you like this ! okay ! before we do anything else , let s get those two wishes granted ! right ! dende ! yes ? ask that piccolo , the nameksei jin who was on earth , be brought back to life ! piccolo san , you say ? got it"
"did you mean you wanted him brought here ? oh , no ! what should we do ? we could use the third wish to bring him vegeta ! i knew it ! i knew it was something like this ! how dare you how dare you try to trick me , vegeta sama , you punks ! ! ? you ll pay for this ! you idiots ! you ve taken the only chance we had to defeat freeza and wasted it ! the only way we can win is if i am made immortal"
"what is that column of light there ? thats where the life sign readings are no ! they couldn t be using the dragonballs to get their wish ! what is thy third wish ? now then , make me immortal ! hurry up and do it now ! lousy brat ! don t you know what do it now means ! ? dende ! you have to do it right now ! freeza is nearly upon us ! if that wish gets granted but we don t have any other choice ! father s injuries won t heal for some time still so this is my homeland ? planet namek"
"i just have to keep after him , and even if i can t do it now , eventually i will defeat him ! very soon now , the time will come when i , vegeta sama , will rule the universe ! what ? what s happened ? why did the dragon disappear , and the sky become light again ? why have the dragonballs turned into those stones ? the senior elder sama has dende the senior elder sama has passed away"
"what do you mean , you little snot ! ? what about my what am i supposed to do about my immortality ! ? what do you want me to say ? you rotten punks ! if you hadn t double crossed me , none of this would have happened ! you re going to pay ! you dirty , rotten fools ! freeza ! you ve really done it now , haven t you , gentlemen ? you have done an outstanding job of shattering my dreams of eternal youth"
"do your worst ! if you think i m going to be that easy to defeat , you re greatly mistaken ! of all the things you might have said apparently , you have forgotten how terrifying i really am"
"and yet , it s such a pity if you had returned as a single , complete nameksei jin , you might have been able to beat freeza"
"you re saying that if i had reunited with kami and become a single individual again , only then would i be able to overcome freeza s power ? that s right"
"you wouldn t lie to me , would you ? if that s what you think , you can go on ahead and get killed by freeza"
"but if i don t like what happens , i ll drive you out again"
"if we re going to do this , let s get it over"
"if i can , i ll do it for my own sake"
"did you think that only three ants could defeat a whole dinosaur ? we can win ! if the three of us fight together , we ll find a way to beat you"
"you irritating rat ! what ! ? what s this ? so , apparently you aren t just talk , are you ? he s right if the three of us fight together , there s a definite chance of us making it through"
"if you want to die that badly , i ll show you"
"if only you had peaceably submitted to me , you would not have to experience this horror now"
i did not mind if it took another three days
"if your father had not tried such a foolish stunt , the saiyajins would have gotten off without being exterminated"
"if you elite warriors combine your powers as one , we are certain to defeat him ! let s show him just how strong we saiyajins are ! freeza sama , some saiyajins , including the royal family , have just arrived and are requesting an audience with you"
"what a load of bull ! if you were really afraid of us saiyajins , simply blowing up planet vegeta would be a completely fruitless measure"
"wh what ! ? unbelievable ! n not even you could reach that high ! if you think i m lying , i ll show you ! dende ! no ! what s this ! ? freeza , you low life , what have you done ! ? what is the deal with this planet ! ? krillin san ? what happened to krillin san ? right here ! y you re bleeding ! it s nothing"
"krillin san ! who would have thought you could still be this spirited ? gohan how does that feel ? not yet ? not yet ? damn it , not yet ? then how long ? calm down , yamcha ! it s not good to get so carried away ! how am i supposed to be calm about this ? right now , goku and krillin and the others are off fighting for their lives against someone so awful , they don t know if they can beat him or not ! and yet , here i am , so far away i want to go and fight as well"
"goku and piccolo are sure to do well ! you must realize the only thing we can do is to continue our training now , so that if we do get to namek , we ll be able to fight as hard as we d like to"
"how about instead , you worry about your own safety ? then again , you can worry all you like , it doesn t matter if you re a nameksei jin or an earthling or a saiyajin it won t , of course , change the fact that you re going to die"
"out out out of my way ! ! what ! ? that kid s power is rising so fast ! how can this be ? such incredible energy ! i can t believe it ! when that kid loses his senses and flies off the handle , he can call up that much power ! ? u unbelievable ! h he may be closer to becoming a super saiyajin than anyone else ! k krillin san ! krillin san krillin san ! it s okay ! he s managed to hang on ! don t die , krillin san ! we don t have time to be worrying about him ! do you think freeza would die from just that ? you aren t any ordinary runt , are you ? even i found that to be a little bit painful ! you did that to the wrong person"
"l i don t care if the kid dies , i m just wondering what i m supposed to do"
"stay alive , gohan ! is there nothing i can do ? if i don t act , i ll be next ! gohan , just hang on"
"now the big finish ! h how can he be ! ? he was supposed to have been at least critically wounded ! w why ! ? kienzan ! kuririn kuririn s ki has been restored ! what s going on ? if you don t like it , come on over here ! come and paddle my bum ! why you how dare you make a fool of me ! th there s no way i can stand against him"
"i ll tear you to bits with my bare hands ! come on out ! die ! taiyo ken ! m my eyes ! thank goodness ! you re not dead ! i ll heal you right now ! r rotten earthling ! calling me out here for such a vain struggle vegeta , now ! attack him ! s so that s what s going on ! what are you doing , vegeta ! ? great ! gohan s been healed ! why did you guys keep silent about the namekian kid having that ability ! ? we didn t keep silent ! we didn t know about it either ! if we had known , we would have him heal goku already ! it doesn t hurt at all any more ! you surprised me , dende ! thanks"
"well , if it isn t the guy we slaughtered back on earth"
"if piccolo is beaten , kami sama will also die"
"if that happens , our chance at resurrection will probably be forever lost"
"what s happening ! ? you ve become a giant , and you re using both hands , yet this is the best you ve got ? that voice i know ! what if i were to fight using only my left hand for you ? something like that cannot possibly work against me , can it ? surely you see there is no way you can win"
"if you do , your current power will be increased several times over"
"attack , goku ! ! an enraged freeza s second transformation incredible ! he s holding his own against freeza ! no , he s doing better ! you really are incredible , piccolo san ! just what the hell has happened ? it hasn t been that long since he was defeated on earth ! we might actually be able to get out of this without dying , gohan ! right ! beat that freeza , who killed so many of us , using the power of nail san ! what kind of training has piccolo undergone ? that s the way , stick with him until i get better ! kaio sama , with piccolo powered up as much as he is , can he defeat freeza ? if he doesn t beat him for us , we re screwed ! so fast ! and i should have the advantage of speed ! kuririn san how can this be ? you mean , he hasn t been taking this seriously up until now ? what s the best step for me to take now ? what should i do ? damn you for making us rejoice prematurely ! nail san piccolo ! what kind of guy is this freeza ! ? piccolo kaio sama ? i told you , they have touched that which should not be touched piccolo sorry about that just now"
"now what ? freeza is a super monster beyond imagination ! you had such confidence in your speed earlier , did you not ? so then , shall we have another look at it ? you bastard ! if you ve got the power , i ve got the speed ! you won t catch up to me in this lifetime ! l it can t be ! my goodness , it has been too long , my little toddler"
"piccolo san has lost his speed advantage over freeza ! does that mean freeza s power has gone up that much ? don t lose , nail san ! thank goodness , you aren t dead ! i ll heal you right away ! that s right ! there s still that trick ! it s all over now , isn t it ? piccolo shall we put an end to this play , then ? d damn you have realized that , unfortunately enough , the speed you took such pride in is of utterly no use against me now , have you not ? i would have you give up now ! s so fast ! piccolo san ! they re impossibly fast ! there s no way he can dodge them ! piccolo san piccolo ! piccolo ! stop it ! gohan ! gohan ! dammit ! wait ! what are you doing , vegeta ! ? there s no sense for you to go ! b but if i don t listen here , at this rate , we re all going to be killed by freeza ! never mind him , you blast me half to death ! do it now ! once i get that kid to heal me , and rise from a near death state one more time , i m certain to be able to become a super saiyan ! having transformed a second time , freeza has become even more powered up"
"after recovering from near death , it is as if he is a different person altogether"
"if i injure myself , there will be no effect ! you must do it ! b but my power isn t enough to bring you to near death ! don t worry"
"and so , gaze upon my final transformation ! my true form ! you rotten p piccolo san ! if you do it now , there s still time"
"hurry ! what ! ? what s wrong with this planet ? it s all over ! i m going to die here ! if i d known son kun was coming , i could have left searching for the dragonballs up to him ! gohan kun is a fool ! kuririn is an idiot ! i hate you , son kun ! freeza s ki is rising again"
"if we had done something like that , he would just blow us away , planet namek and all ! he doesn t have any more use for this planet ! t that is one impossibly huge ki"
"freeza , or anyone else , bring it on ! i have now become a super saiyan ! so this is freeza ? such an incredible ki ! at last , freeza completes his third transformation"
"you dare say ! just be grateful you don t have a scouter with you ! if your scouter were to read my battle rating now , you would run away from here in tears ! the reason being , my power has now become even greater than yours ! brace yourself , freeza"
"if you mean everything you said , then i ve decided to see for myself the power of this so called , legendary super saiyan , the strongest warrior in history"
"if you are as you say , does that mean that s the best the strongest in history can do ? up until this point , i could see him don t make me laugh"
"well ? have you started to regret how foolish you ve been ? you lower life form , nothing in your mind but fighting saiyajin san ? i thought you at least were different , and i pampered you , but you re just like the others , aren t you ? if you hadn t turned against me , we would have gotten by without having to go through this"
"v vegeta ! if you want to save him , feel free at any time"
"k kakarrot vegeta ! are you still reciting that soft crap ? are you not a super saiyan ! ? wait ! you foolish scum ! get cold hearted ! if you had only discarded your leniency , you would surely already be a super saiyan ! i just don t see how i could act as cold hearted as you do"
"now , then he s not that bad you re an impudent one ! what s this ? l it s an eruption ! what s it doing there ? father ! gohan ! if you go , you ll just get in the way"
i wonder if he s burned up
"that was close , that was close ! if i d fallen in there , i would ve died ! here goes"
"piccolo ! ? if he hangs around with the likes of him , gohan chan will become a delinquent ! i can t dawdle around any longer ! let go of me ! let me go ! the repairs to the spaceship aren t likely finished yet ! that kinda thing takes a lotta time ! that s right ! ah , here , everyone s all together ! the third time around , i could handle it without even looking at the blueprints"
"at this point , we all go together listen here ! if we all put our efforts together , we just may be of help to goku and the others ! why d ya need me too ! ? you seem to be much stronger than i thought"
i wonder if old man turtle hermit is doing okay
"i think i ll torment him a little that bastard ! this is telekinesis ! dammit ! okay , if that s how it is you are impudent ! what is this ! ? it s like a whole island ! an island is floating there ! goku ! this is the end for sure"
"you ve fallen for it ! oh , hell ! i can t move ! this serves you right ! when i miss , you re finished ! if i don t somehow find my way out of this ! we re just about at game set ! are you getting tired of this ? what ! ? you might die this time , huh ? gohan ! ah , piccolo san ! goku father what kind of guys are these ! ? freeza s just playing around ! if he felt like it , he s got the power to destroy this whole planet"
"here i am fighting someone so incredibly strong , and i m giddy with excitement ! if you re not going to come at me , then i ll bring it to you again ! you know something , i m glad i met you ! i was getting so bored , and the creatures on this planet are all so weird anyhow ah , sorry , sorry ! i ve hurt your feelings ! you re an exception ! when i first saw all of you clustered around , i was all freaked out , but you alone were different ! that s enough ! who would ever expect me to die here among all these frogs ! ? ah , so gross ! you seemed to have a lot of promise , so i ll let you be my friend ! do you want to eat some too ? for a frog , you re really eating this stuff , huh ? well then would you eat some of this , too ? it s been a long time since i laughed so hard ! overall , you really do seem to understand what i m saying"
"say ! if we had a translator device , i bet i could talk to you ! i m so clever ! it s finished ! that was easier than i expected"
"well , let me offer my service , if you want to call it that , by giving you some advice"
"if you were to become one of my men , wonderful things would await you every day"
"is this the power of freeza ? fantastic ! bulma san that over there isn t me ! it s a frog , a frog ! i m bulma ! you have to understand ! all right ! nice ! ah , i get it ! you re you ve finally gotten it , huh ! ? you re that ginyu guy ! what are you doing hanging around in a place like this ? you d better hurry and seek shelter somewhere , it s dangerous here ! that s not it ! using about percent , or in other words , half of my max power , i can turn you into space dust ! he ain t bluffing what speed ! i didn t see that at all ! son ! father ! bravo ! what an attack to behold ! to think that i should be able to see freeza sama s form like this ! i i freeza sama , i m so glad i trusted and stayed with you ! what are you saying , bulma san ? father is the one getting beaten up ! that s right ! bulma san , please go somewhere safe and take refuge right away ! what are you talking about ! ? i ll never see another fight like this ! i wonder if she hit her head or something back when we left her by herself"
"again , i couldn t see freeza s movement can there be this much difference in our powers ? didn t i say so ? if i use only half of my max power , i could turn you into space dust , as i recall"
"l i see o oh no ! is there anything else ? goku there s nothing to worry about , chaozu ! goku is going to win this fight ! aren t you forgetting about the kaio ken technique ? with goku as he is now , he should be able to withstand as much as ten times his regular power ! oh , yeah ! that s it ! all right ! all right , all right ! no regrettably , what he s using right now is that very x kaio ken it can t be ! t this isn t good ! there s too much difference in their abilities ! father bulma san ? that s our freeza sama ! against goku such grandeur ! w who the hell are you ! ? who , me ? watch out , piccolo ! as kaio s words cut off any encouraging news about goku , who is already using a ten fold kaio ken , is there any glimmer of hope remaining for him ? and what of ginyu , as he closes in ?"
"your body is mine ! chan ge ! what ! ? piccolo , watch out ! i i can t move ! piccolo san ! p piccolo san w what happened ? my hands my feet my body my cheek ! yea ! yea , yea ! i m back in my original body ! ow , ow ! t thank goodness , bulma san , but it s very dangerous here ! if you don t take cover soon enough already ! bulma san ! get over here and save me ! this is getting ridiculous"
"you can entertain me a little bit more , if you like"
"what a technique ! as i told you , if i had to , i could destroy this whole planet"
"w what did he do ? h he s cut the whole planet ! n never mind that , i have to wonder if goku is planning something"
"but if , like he says , he really is only using fifty percent of his power now , there ain t nothing else i can do it s much too late for you to start agonizing"
"you will become my toy , until i grow tired of you ! what s the matter ? if you don t resist a little for me , i will find you unresponsive and get bored ! hey , hey , the fun is just beginning ! it s much too soon for you to be going to bed ! it s no use ! how does it feel to become a fish ? kuririn ! goku sa ! g goku ! chichi ! where are you ! ? old man turtle hermit ! oolong ! o old timer ! chichi ! goku sa ! goku sa ! father ! gohan ! father ! w what ! ? father ! g goku ! for the future of gohan , chichi , earth , and planet namek i absolutely must not lose ! ! fifty percent power , he says whether those words are a bluff , or whether they ain t , all i can do is stake everything on a ka me ha me ha ! ! damn it to hell ! now that even his twenty fold kaio ken was of no use , is there any chance of victory left for goku ?"
"this is because he fears the birth of what is said to be the strongest warrior in the universe , the legendary super saiyan ! if i could have , i would have killed him by my own hand"
"and then i get killed like a rag doll ! if you understand my anguish , then be sure to kill him by your hand ! i don t understand what it is you re thinking"
"there ll probably be too much force to it ! it will be hard not to squash the planet itself ! but if i don t wipe out freeza here and now , the universe itself could be torn apart ! i don t know if this is going to go right or not , but it s all i can do now ! what s this you re doing ? you re still thinking of trying some kind of nonsense , are you ? what can you possibly do , as worn out as you are ? g goku can you really beat freeza with a genki dama ? w what s this i m sensing ? l it s g genki dama l it can t be ! a genki dama , loaded with the hopes of the universe"
"he takes care of the bad guys in the blink of an eye ! get it ! ? if son kun goes all out , that strange alien would be finished with one blow ! you re friends with that alien , aren t you ? if you are friends , then it s in that alien s best interest for you to stop him before son kun gets serious ! how about you go persuade him ? make that clear to him ! make it clear ! l it s huge ! man , is that huge ! is it really all that huge ? the one on earth was about this big"
"we re not at all like vegeta ! that s right ! if my luck hadn t turned on me , i would have taken that monkey scum out with one shot ! well , we don t need to dwell on the past"
"you guys are an annoyance ! you ll have to leave ! don t you ask such a selfish thing ! you guys get out of here ! yeah , yeah ! these young men here want to have a go at us ! interesting ! and just as we re here wanting to get rowdy on someone ! whoa , before we do , hasn t the commander always said that once we get to a new planet , we should try out our techniques first ? that there are techniques whose effectiveness depend on the place ? that s right ! okay then dammit ! how dare you destroy someone else s things ! so , now it s my turn"
"why don t you test me to see if i m joking or not ? okay , then ! goku s genki dama ! cut it out already ! how long do you intend to just stand there like that ? good question"
"how long indeed ? damn you ! ! h he s found out ! no ! not yet ! so , what s the matter ? you were going to attack me somehow , right ? are you trying to make a fool of me ? a little more so , what are you going to do ? g goku ! father ! gohan , kuririn , give over what remaining ki you have to me ! give it to me , now ! right ! hey , don t be in such a rush ! don t toy with me , you monkey scum ! don t think about anything else ! concentrate your ki ! right ! i can t tell what saiyans are thinking"
looks as if he s finally found it out
"gohan , kuririn , you two stay here ! no matter what happens , stay back ! h he s been forming that up in the sky ! ? where did he find that much remaining power ! ? it s no use ! even if i use the genki dama now , he will avoid it ! besides which , that ball still ain t enough to defeat freeza , dammit ! you were planning to take me by surprise with that ? you re so pathetic ! however , even this desperate measure has become worthless ! too bad ! damn ! be gone ! piccolo ! goku , hurry up and complete this genki dama of yours ! i owe you one ! make it fast , goku ! with the power i have , it was all i could do just to blindside him ! gotcha ! are you still lurking about , you miserable namekian ! ? so , let s stop the chatter and blow all these guys away ! ah , wait ! i m leaving this up to you guys ! y you wouldn t ! our opponents are awfully tough ! ten san ! piccolo accomplishes a flawless support strike"
"hey , if we get serious , they ll be no problem ! hey , reacoom , shake it off ! nice ! this is how it ought to be ! i am totally up for this ! reacoom body attack ! ! all right ! hey ! ginyu special corps red magma , jheese ! ginyu special corps blue hurricane , butta ! now ! goku , isn t the genki dama ready yet ? still longer , goku ? i ve just about reached my limit"
"if piccolo dies , kami sama dies too"
"father ! don t concern yourself about me ! i will be sure to return to earth later ! b but how will you ? if we take your spaceship back don t argue ! do you want to annoy me ! ? father thank you ! thank you , father ! i ll be waiting"
"father i ain t forgiving you , even if you apologize"
"dammit ! y you dodged it ! t there s no way you could have ! w why you ! if only i could hit you , you d be ! hit me and see"
"i i am freeza ! you re telling me i m finished ! ? that s it ! the spaceship that father rode here in ! still not yet ! ? if you don t cut that out , i m really goin to get angry ! i have mentioned that this would be a piece of cake yeow ! if you would not rush me so"
"i have to go get bulma san ! gohan chan ! don t you be goin anywhere ! you stay right where you are ! i m waiting here for you ! wait , gohan ! wait , i say ! if it is to come down to me being killed by the likes of you , i will choose death by my own hand ! whichever you like"
"so then , what about goku and the others ? if the planet is lost , no one can survive"
"is that so ? if i could have you wait briefly , i can have those who have been in your care resurrected"
"if you used all your power , your body couldn t withstand it ! i can t let you stall for any more time ! i m going to settle this now ! there are five minutes until the destruction of planet namek"
"if only l , freeza , weren t around ! miserable idiot ! if you had only beaten freeza before he attained full power , this wouldn t be happening"
"we re always together , aren t we ? you can t ! ten san , that won t do ! if you guys are going to remain here , then as far as i m concerned what are you saying ! ? you have bulma waiting for you , don t you ? y yeah , but wait a second ! hold on , hold on ! say , kami of earth , can those dragonballs resurrect two people at the same time ? hm ? er , yes , so long as the conditions are the same"
"kaio sama , what is it ? all right , it s decided then ! kami , change that wish for me ! make it , please return to life all those killed by freeza and his ring , okay ? aren t we to son kun s spaceship yet ? if we don t get off this dangerous planet as soon as possible , we ll never set foot on the soil of earth again ! yes , i know that"
i wonder if he wouldn t rather like to stay here
"o okay , already ! well , what else can i do ? he s unconscious and all , so there s nothing to worry about , right ? what ! ? we ve reached the limit ! if we stay here any longer , we won t be able to take off ! you can t ! father still hasn t come ! son kun will be fine ! he s sure to escape somehow or other ! please , bulma san ! for father ! wait for father , please ! just one more minute will be enough ! g gohan kun hold out against this , piccolo ! if you and i die now , all hope will disappear as well ! kami sama ! kami sama ! kami sama , dragonballs gathered"
"if something happens to him , my parents will blame me"
"if i go home without him , my dad will yell where s your brother ? you weren t looking out for him"
if i don t get out of school and get ike back my parents will disown me
"if you visitors can hear me , bring back my brother , goddamn it ! that hurts , you butt licker ! kyle , look , it s them"
"mom ? yes , hon ? if anybody calls or visits , i m not here , okay ? sure"
why don t you get the fat kid ? why ? if the fat kid has something implanted in his ass maybe he s a part of the visitors plan
if you can find it in your hearts to give my brother back it would make my life brighter again

"sir , if making mutant animals spliced with humans is crazy , then never mind"
police request that if you see this boy you immediately kill him and burn his body

"so , uh , if you re against the war , run along outside , and if you re for the war , uh , stay here and we ll do math problems"
"hey all you un american bastards ! if you don t like america , why don t you get out ? ! don t you call us un american ! this country was founded on the right to protest ! m kay ? if the founding fathers saw you burning your flag an callin the president a nazi , they d roll over in their grave ! yeah ! right ! the founding fathers would agree with our right to protest ! foundin fathers would kick all your asses ! boys , what do you think the founding fathers would say ? eh the founding who ? well , i hope you little commies are pretty pleased with yourselves ! going out there and protesting america , and then saying on national television that you don t even know who the founding fathers are ! you kids don t know squat about america , do you ? mmuh well , not really , no"

"if i have a flashback , then i can see what was like first hand ! no , you just have to study"
"that isn t gonna work , dumbass ! kids , let s keep it down for study group , or else mr"
"gentlemen , if you will clear the doorway , please ? oh gee , i m wondering what it used to be like in the year"
"that s bullcrap , mayor ! our rally to support the war was set up months ago ! there was no war months ago ! hey , if you don t like america , then you can get out ! look , nobody wants to hear a bunch of twangy country music prowar propaganda ! well nobody wants to hear a bunch o rock protest songs ! well up yours , rednecks ! rabble ! rabble ! rabble ! rabble ! rabble ! rabble ! quiet people ! the town square is public space"
"that means if neither group will nicely and maturely move the day of its rally , i ll just have have to give the town square to both groups"
"nobody wants to here another pro war country song ! well excuse me if i m a little bit country well i m a little bit rock n roll i m a little for supportin our troops and i m a little for bringin them home i believe freedom isn t free no , but war shouldn t be our goal we must defend our country if it means war , then we say no ! yeehaw ! did you forget them towers in new york ? did you forget how it made you feel to see them towers come down ? were you like me ? did you think it weren t real ? i like to rock , but i don t wanna rock iraq ! the only kind of rockin america should do is the kind that we can all dance to , yeah ! gps , icbms , and good old fashioned lead we re gonna show saddam what america means that son of a bitch will be dead why are we fightin this war ? there s a man in the office we didn t vote for they didn t give me a choice war is not my voice ! yeaaaaahhhh ! we must go to war ! but what about the violence ? the lives lost ? ! if we found a country , it should be founded on peace and diplomacy"
"i must state again for the record that south carolina , north carolina , pennsylvania , maryland , and georgia are against war ! yeah , because you don t care about the fate of the colonies like we do ! you re all unpatriotic ! and if you don t like the colonies , then you can get out ! don t you call us unpatriotic ! we re protesting this war because we care so deeply for the fate of our colonies ! you are all unpatriotic for leading the colonies into a war that half of them don t want ! whoa , how very very relevant"
"franklin , where do you stand on the war issue ? i believe that if we are to form a new country , we cannot be a country that appears war hungry and violent to the rest of the world"
"so , what if we form a country that appears to want both ? yes"
"if the people of our new country are allowed to do whatever they wish , then some will support the war and some will protest it"
"if we allow the people to protest what the government does , then the country will be forever blameless"
"if you all don t mind , i would like to do my report now"
"and you people who are anti war , you need these flag wavers , because , if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters , we d get taken down in a second"
"yeah , but if it weren t for all you guys protesting , why everyone around the world would hate the american people instead of just the president"
"and if it weren t for you people flexing your arms , america could easily get taken over by terrorists or or china"
i don t think j lo would like it very much if we signed this new girl

"if we really want to see cash flow , we need to bring in city people from denver"

"that means if we won again , it will be twelve and a quarter million ! we can save the town and be super rich ! oh hell yeah ! let it ride ! let it ride ! woohoo ! yeah ! what the hell are they doing ? let s go thirty one ! let s see it ! two , red"

"what is the state of our people ? last nignt i spoke with the spirit of the bear , and bear said that if we do not build our superhighway soon , our investors may soon sell off their shares of the new casino"
"and the spirit of the wind has stated that if we use force , it could be a publicity nightmare , further hurting our net assets"
"free blanket ? free blanket ? free blanket tom , it now looks as if the native americans are handing out blankets as a sign of goodwill towards the south park people"

"did you have an inward journey with the old man ? did you have a vision ? ah , i don t know if i did or not"
"we don t have time for all that , chef ! oh , if only those queer eye for the straight guy people understood what they were doing"
"if we keep trying to make straight people into us , well , we re gonna have no identity left"
"we are the crab people ! jesus christ ! crab people ! crab people ! crab people ! crab people ! see now where we have been forced to live for a thousand years ! but soon we shall rule the land above , and mankind will be gone ! gone ? crab people are too small and weak to take over man by force , and so we came up with our perfect plan ! if you can t beat man , change man ! i knew it ! i knew gay people would never do this to their own kind ! when all the world is metrosexual , the crab people shall finally reign supreme ! crab people ! crab people ! taste like crab , talk like people"
"if we can t make you into metrosexuals , then we will make you into crab people ! take them ! all things just keep getting better you came into my life and my world never looked so bright , yeah it s true , you bring out the best in me when you are around , when you are around , all things just keep getting better tom , i m standing in south park , colorado , where the first annual metrosexual pride parade is underway ! we re here ! we re not queer ! but we re close ! get used to it ! that does it ! i can t take it anymore ! i should have never wished for a cleaner , neater husband"
we have to define our style if we re ever going to make a platinum album
"don t you see ? see what ? our band should play christian rock ! christian rock ? ! think about it ! it s the easiest crappiest music in the world , right ? if we just play songs about how much we love jesus , all the christians will buy our crap ! that s a retarded idea , cartman ! it worked for creed ! i don t wanna be in a stupid christian rock band ! you just start that way , stan , then you cross over"
"it s genius ! just get the hell out of here , cartman ! you re not serious and you re a detriment to the band ! oh yeah ? ! i will bet you ten bucks that if i start a christian rock band that i can get a platinum album before you guys do ! you re on , fat boy ! okay , fine ! ready ? first one to have a platinum album wins ! go ! what a stupid asshole ! platinum album ! platinum album ! gotta make a platinum album before kyle ! oh , hi eric"
"wait ! walk out that door , token , and you ll regret it the rest of your life ! christians have a built in audience of over one hundred and eighty million americans ! if each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety five cents , that would be two billion , three hundred and thirty one million dollars"
"if things keep going the way they are , the child will not get his tropical paradise"
"we re sorry ! we ll , we ll never download music for free again ! man must learn to think of these horrible outcomes before he acts selfishly or else i fear recording artists will be forever doomed to a life of only semi luxury"
"my heart would simply snap , my lord , if you walked on out that door"
"boy , i ll say ! if you parents will just step over here , you can pay their four hundred dollar release and penalty fees"
"no ! didn t you guys learn anything ? look , if we make an album , all that s gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the internet"
"damnit ! if we re gonna sell our hot christian album , we have got to get on that stage ! hey , is this the way to the backstage ? who are you ? we re the band sanctified"
"in a recent poll , we asked people if moop s refusal to play would stop them from downloading music off the internet"
"i resent that , sir ! i have never in my life done anything just for the money ! if i m lying , may the lord strike me down right now"
"you guys , we can t give up on our dreams now ! as soon as this strike ends , we re gonna be the biggest band ever ! yeah , if we all give in now , people might never stop downloading our music for free ! i m sure we re gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop"
but why play if we re not gonna make millions of dollars ? because that s what real artists do
"if we re real musicians , then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening"
"besides , maybe our songs would have gotten downloaded for free , but if they were good songs , then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert"
"i ll be god damned if they think they can take my license away ! oooh , hi dad"
"and i will be god damned if the government thinks it can step in and take away my right to drive ! i think old people should have rights , grandpa"
"you save more gas if you take the highway to country kitchen buffet ! less miles means less gas , you old fool"
"if all the seniors in town are at a meeting , that means that when the meeting gets out every senior in town will be driving home at the same time"
we ll stay the whole winter if we have to
"guys , i don t know if i ever told you this , but , well , i love you guys"
"we ll tell them if they don t give us our demands , we ll start killin hostages ! huh , right"
"stan ! boys ! you re safe ! dad , why is everyone letting old people do this ? why doesn t somebody stop them ? they ve tried to stop them , son , but the seniors get up so early in the morning they get everything done before everyone else is even awake ! they re saying something about taking over the whole country"
"ech , even if it could work , how would we go about shutting it down ? i think i have a plan , though we ll have to do it tonight"
"wuh ih uh weh come on , kyle , who the hell else are you gonna take besides stan and kenny ? i m gonna take butters"
"i ll just , i ll just die if you don t take me ! please ! sorry , my mind s made up"
"w w what seems to be the p p p prrroblem ? well , everybody likes you , jimmy , a and you seem to be really good with people , so , i was wondering if you could tell me , how do you act nice to people ? well , the best thing is not to act nice , eric"
"now you say , ingmar bergman who ? take that , jimmy ! and that ! and don t you ever talk bad about kyle again ! kyle is my friend ! and if you say you had sex with his mom one more time , i m gonna really let you have it ! you hear me ? oh , kyle"
"and , and hey , if for some reason butters can t go to casa bonita , you can take his place"
"but what about everyone else ? i have to tell my parents so they can come here , too"
"now butters , listen no matter what happens , no matter what you hear , do not come out ! if i don t make it back in time with the others , then it will be up to you to repopulate the earth"
"uh , please , let us know if you find out anything"
"oh my god , let me see ! no butters ! if you come up , you ll get infected too ! you best wait for the radiation level to go down"
"we can t come down there , or else , we ll contaminate you , butters"
"three days is a long time , but we ve got to keep going if we re gonna find him"
"let s move out , people ! every second counts ! but if you leave me now , you ll take away the biggest part of me"
"no ! i m gonna watch the cliff divers first ! maybe if i tell them it s my birthday , they ll let me cliff dive in the pool ! oh , that would be so bad ass ! finally i can breathe a oh my god"
"huh ? it s really tough being in a totally new place , but i think all you guys are really cool so i understand if there s initiation rites"
"hey , kids ! why don t you grab your instruments and play a song for stan ! oh yeah ! all right ! let s play ! yeah yeah , yeah , i love my family ! my family is the best ! if we ever have to face a challenge"
"i was asking god if i should be a protestant , or a catholic , or what ? and suddenly god and jesus appeared before me"
"if he thinks he can fill my son s head with wacko religious crap , he s wrong ! randy , don t cause trouble"
you gotta put these cult people in their place or else they never stop ! i m gonna go kick this mr
"because first i must translate what s written on the plates into english , so you can all read it ! dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb wow , amazing ! he found the stones and golden plates dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb even though nobody else ever saw them dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb so , how d it go , clubber lange ? you kicked mr"
"if joseph smith really is translating off of golden plates , then he ll be able to do it again"
"but if joseph smith is making it all up , then the new translations will be different from these"
"lucy harris smart smart smart martin harris dumb so martin went on back to smith said the pages had gone away smith got mad and told martin he needed to go pray dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb look , ah i m sorry about losin the pages we worked on , joe , but i m ready to write it all down again if you translate from the plates"
"wow ! if god got angry with you , then you must be tellin the truth"
"no , it s a matter of logic ! if you re gonna say things that have been proven wrong , like that the first man and woman lived in missouri , and that native americans came from jerusalem , then you d better have something to back it up"
"the truth is , i don t care if joseph smith made it all up , because what the church teaches now is loving your family , being nice and helping people"
"so butt out ! butt out ! yeah yeah ! give that cigarette butt a throw ! huh , jesus christ ! butt out ! uh huh ! smokin s got to go ! remember , kids , if you smoke , you could grow up to be a failure"
"so don t believe what those evil tobacco companies tell you ! yeah , because if you don t smoke , you can grow up to be just like us"
"d awww sick ! gross , dude ! well hey , if i didn t know any better , i d think you boys have been smoking ! no no , mr"
"and uh , if you start smokin at an early age , m kay , it s gonna be bad"
"if everyone s blaming the tobacco companies , then nobody s blaming us"
"if we re gonna take them down , we ve gotta lie right back ! oh my god ! excuse me ! yes ? would you mind putting that death stick out ? but , uh , this is a bar"
"not if i were around , they wouldn t have"
"which means , if it weren t for tobacco , many of our black friends wouldn t be here today"
"and if it gives me cancer when i m eighty i don t care who the hell wants to be ninety anyway ? so with a hidey lidey lidey and a hidey lidey lay we work and we make cigarettes all hidey lidey day so folks can get a breaky from their stressful lidey lives and relaxy with the cigarettes we make all day and night well , i guess that s the end of our tour"
"you guys have to help me ! no dude , get away ! please , you guys , i don t know what to do ! stop it , cartman ! go die on your own ! if i go , you guys go ! dad ! what ? anti smoking people are trying to kill cartman and he won t stay away from us"
even if it means getting grounded
"why ? because , if we go to the tobacco company , i know exactly what ll happen"
"god damnit ! give us the child ! we will not ! there , you see that ? ! the tobacco company won t give us the kid ! and do you know why ? because they know that if they give us that kid , then we ll kill him ! and when our commercial goes on the air , it will lose them business ! yeah ! yeah , that s right ! wait a minute , what ? yeah"
"oh , god damnit , do i have to explain this again ? smoking is bad , people ! so if we have to be a little extreme to stop it , it s okay ! no it isn t , you fat turd ! because , i ve learned something today"
"yeah , like stan gives a crap if wendy breaks up"
"dude , i don t have time to start over with other girls ! i m nine years old , dude ! if i don t work things out with wendy , i could be alone my whole life ! she wants to see me again ! my raisins girl said she wants to see me again ! i can t let wendy go ! this whole time i ve been having my friends do all the talking for me ! it s time i took control ! what are you doing ? something i should have done a long time ago"
"stan , why don t you show her you love her ? if you really want wendy back , try doing the most romantic thing you can think of"
"okay , so what s the most romantic thing i can think of ? if you really want a shot at getting her back stand outside her window , hold a boom box up over your head and play peter gabriel"
"dude , you need to snap out of this ! so wendy left you for token , what are you gonna do , just be miserable your whole life ? there s nothing else i can do"
"but if life is only pain , then , what s the point of living ? just to make life more miserable for the conformists"
"all right , so how do i join you ? if you want to be one of the non conformists , all you have to do is dress just like us and listen to the same music we do"
"first of all , there s a five foot rule if you come within five feet of a customer , you need to acknowledge them , even if they re not at your table , hey , cutie ! when you re not serving food or talking with customers , you need to dance around and have fun"
"oh man , i am so bored , thank god you guys came in ! if you want good tips , the most important thing is physical contact , just a simple hold of the arm can be the difference between and"
you can t be a non conformist if you don t drink coffee
"who else wants a signed raisins girls calendar for ? ! woo hoo ! alright ! steven , what is this place ? i don t know here you go , porsche will be right with you"
"oh i see , you don t approve of my girlfriend ! well , let me tell you something , mom and dad , our love is as pure as a mountain spring ! the odds may be stacked against us , but we re gonna give it our best shot ! and so if you can t be happy for us , you can just go to heck , mom and dad ! come on , lexus ! i m moving out of my parents house , and i m moving in with you , let s blow this joint ! what are you talking about , kid ? we are not boyfriend and girlfriend ! what , lexus , what are you saying ? are you saying you don t want to be together anymore ? i m sorry , sweetie"
"that s cool , i guess you can join up with us if you want"
"the only way i could feel this sad now is if i felt something really good before , so i have to take the bad with the good , so i guess what i m feeling is like a beautiful sadness i guess that sounds stupid"
"gints , but to be honest , i think it would be best for ike if you didn t come around again"
"you d better ! dad , can t we talk to this new canadian prime minister ? if he knew the situation , he might oh ! kyle , appealing to the prime minister of canada would take time and money we don t have"
"what if we miss out on some great christmas adventure ? please , you guys , you don t understand"
"if we go as soon as possible , then dude , we just can t up and go to canada"
"kyle , i just want you to know , if it were any other time of the year , i still wouldn t help you"
"what if this christmas , instead of buyin presents , we all use that money to give to the broflovskis ? ha ! yeah , right ! like our parents aren t gonna buy us presents for christmas ! that s a great idea , chef"
"if we can change his mind before christmas , then your parents won t have to give my family money"
"you really think if we go to canada , we might still get christmas presents ? it s worth a shot"
"but if it doesn t work , you and me are gonna have it out , kyle"
"if your seats have seatbelts , this is the time you will fasten them"
"everyone , it s not an invasion ! hey ! we re in canada ! well of course you are ! and canada friends welcomes you ! welcome , friend , to canada ! canada friends loves you ! we re just like any other country without the big tattoo we greet thee with pleasure , but one question , if we may ? what brings you folks to canada ? why are you here today ? uh"
"the question is , is what ? you must talk to the new prime minister if you think his brother s home s back there"
our parents still have time to buy us presents if we hurry
"but our funding has been cut and now we re forced to ride but if you don t mind , we re in a rush to see the new prime minister"
"ze ozer canada is hardly canada if you lived here for a day , you d understand welcome to french canada"
"if you are going to see za new prime minister , then i want to go with you"
"very good ! let us make haste ! there z no canada like french canada , it z za bezt canada in ze land and ze ozer canada is a bullshit canada if you lived here for a day , you d understand i think you d understand you understand oh my ! this certainly is a desolate place ! it reminds me of death and fear"
"is it working ? oh , god damnit ! well i warned you kyle ! i told you if i missed christmas we were gonna throw down ! well it s on ! we re gonna have it out right now ! of course , we could always take my boat , eh ? oh yes ! on the river , we could travel to ottawa in no time ! well , come on ! okay , next stop , the new prime minister"
"yeah ! you got your brother back , but i didn t get any presents ! and what did i tell you , kyle ? i told you that if we didn t make it back in time for christmas i was gonna whup your ass , didn t i ? ! dude , come on"
"and if the road warrior says it , it must be true"
"that doesn t count , fatass ! yeah , that it , cartman ! you don t get to have any powers ! c mon ! well well well ! if it isn t the four ninjas ! who the hell is that ? ? i dunno"

"you guys can t fix my eyeball ! you have to take me to the hospital ! if we take him to the hospital , they re gonna find out what happened"
"god damnit ! god ? please , if you get me out of this , i swear , i will never play with weapons ever again"
"so if we make butters up to look like a dog , ohh no"
"ohoo but , but fellas , if i , if i dress up like a dog with a star in my eye , i i m gonna get grounded"
"we re outta here ! no dude , you gotta help us find him ! the hell with that ! we re in this together , craig ! if butters tells on us , we re gonna tell on you , and that s the ninja code ! hello ? anybody eh"
"now the ninjas were in serious trouble , because their parents might find out they had weapons if professor chaos told on them"
"it was during this battle that professor chaos escaped , and so the four ninjas were forced to join forces with craig and his friends to find professor chaos , or else they would all be grounded"
if you can
"listen , doucher ! our parents are gonna kill us , and you , if they found out that we bought these ! i thought you told me your parents were dead"
"well , like the rest of you , i am shocked and appalled at what happened ! i don t know if the parents are to blame or if it s the times we re living in , but something has to change ! this is the worst thing that s happened in this town ! the worst thing ! yeah ! i mean , there were children watching that auction ! and when that little eight year old boy walked up and flashed his penis it was an outrage ! what ? what ? not only that , the auction was televised on public access , so my little daughter watchin at home saw the penis ! how am i suppsoed to explain that to her ? ! this is what happens when the moral fabric of society breaks down ! you see the damage you ve caused , eric cartman ? ! what were you thinking ? ! i told you it was a wardrobe malfunction ! dude , they don t care we knocked butters eye out with weapons ? just run with it , dude"
i guess parents don t give a crap about violence if there s sex things to worry about
"timmy ! ! ! say fellas , jimmy and i were wondering if maybe you would come and cheer for us next sssaturday"
if somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks ! oh no
y you sure you weren t masturbating jim ? it s okay if you were
"no you re not ! i read the brochure , cartman ! if you re under eighteen , you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the special olympics"
"i ve sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people god put here on earth for my amusement , but now i m starting to think that if i could just spend one day in their shoes , if i could just see the challenges they face every day , mauye i wouldn t be so cold"
"i know that i often have serious moral objections to the things that you do , but this time i think you really need to reconsider , because if you do this , i believe you will go to hell"
"if you had seen the passion you would know that hell is reserved for the jews , and all those who don t accept christ"
"but i know now that even if you do win on steroids , you re really not a winner"
"you re just a big fat p pppussy , and if you take steroids , the only decent thing to do is come forward and say , remove me from the record books , because i am a big , stinky p pussy steroid taking jackass"
"and if you ll let me , i ll be back next year"

"oh honey , let s be good christians from now on ! i think if more people saw the passion they d have faith in jesus"
"oh , we will ! this is america ! and in america , if something sucks , you re supposed to be able to get your money back ! come on , kenny ! kill him ! guilty ! kill him ! kill him ! kill him ! die ! kill jesus ! yesss ! okay , search for mel gibson"
"look , kid , we just thought it was a bad movie , so tell us how to get in touch with mel gibson so we can get our money back ! if i knew where mel gibson was , i d be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment , sir"
"leave it to a child to show us all the way , huh ? yeah , so i see this ad on the internet saying if you love the passion to come to this meeting , so here i am ! it s great that everyone came here to figure out how to use the passion to enrich everyone s lives"
"yes , and then we can begin the cleansing , if you know what i mean"
"because , even if jesus wasn t really the son of god , he was still a nice guy"
"but how can the jews make it better ? ? well , if you really care about your friend s soul , then perhaps show him the way of jesus"
"and now one of our fine young shlokas , kyle broflovski , has asked if he could speak to the congragation"
"what ? whatwhatwhaaat ? ! if we as a people choose not to believe that jesus is the son of god , then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed , and take our share of the responsibility for it"
"see what you can fit in there , i can take it ! dude ! i ve been freaked out this whole time because of that guy s movie ? fine ! if nobody here is man enough to torture me , then just give me my eighteen dollars ! it s our eighteen dollars ! your movie sucked ! you can t say my movie sucked , or else you re saying christianity sucked ! no , dude , if you wanna be christian , that s cool , but , you should follow what jesus taught instead of how he got killed"
"naw , that s crap , sharon ! stanley , when somebody challenges you to dance , you have to dance back at them , or else they ll think you re weak"

"robot , how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood ? seventeen"
"if we got our hands on that robot , we could reprogram it and turn it into a weapon !"
"hold on a second if that robot is designed for entertainment , turning it into a weapon is unethical"
scientist ! we understand that the robot is from japan ! that means that the japanese have more of them ! and if the japanese fabricates one of them into a weapon before we do jesus

i don t even know if what we re doing is right
"if we had , we would have framed him ourselves"
"well , if you re gonna give away all your money , then , i guess we can drop all those charges"
"we all have the power to change if we search inside our hearts and we start to heal the wounds of all our yesterdays and you know it might be hard , but all you ve got to do is start , and you can change all of your evil molesting ways"
"all you ever do is talk about your balls ! it works , doesn t it ? did i not just get us an extra five bucks ? if you want your share of the money , then you re gonna shovel snow like the rest of us ! hey ! don t boss me around , you fuckin jew ! i will kick your ass ! ma am , do you have a rag and some bandages ? oh goodness , what happened ? shoveling accident"
"if you re just joining us , a man from over two thousand years into the future has come through a one way time portal looking for work"
"it appears that another person from the future has just arrived ! it looks as if the job at wendy s did work for the original immigrant this second arrivee claims that man s family is now much better off , and wishes the same for his family"
"would you like snow shoveling service again today ? ooo , oh dear , i m sorry boys , but i ve already hired someone else to do it"
they re only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do
"now , pissed off redneck , you say we shouldn t allow anyone else through the time portal , aright ? you re goddamned right ! these people from the future are takin all the work away from us decent present day americans ! they took our jobs ! they took our jobs ! those jobs belong to people from the present ! aright"
it is our greedy multinational corporations that keep everyone else in poverty
"dude , hold on ! this is bullcrap ! if they wanna live in our time , then they should learn our language ! yeah ! that s right ! hey now , these immigrants have a right to retain their culture"
"what ? that s ridiculous ! they can t do that ! that was a good idea ! so it appears the government ain t gonna help us ! which means we gotta take matters into our own hands ! the only way to stop people from the future is to stop the future from happening ! hey that s right ! if there is no future , then there ll be no people from the future to come back and take our jobs ! take rjurbs all right ! so , any ideas how we can stop the future from happening ? how about we cause more global warming , so that in the future , the polar ice caps melt , and and it ushers in a new ice age ? how the hell is global warming gonna cause an ice age ? ! well you know , the global warming could bring on like a climate shift or somethin ? chet , you are a fuckin retard , you know that ? ! even if global warming were real , which all proven scientific data shows it isn t , it would take millions of years for a climate shift to happen ! you think an ice age can just happen all of a sudden like ? well i was just tryin to be helpful"
"well that s not a bad idea ! what ? gettin gay ? think about it these people are from the future , right ? well , if we can git everyone to turn queer , then there won t be no children to have no children , and the people from the future won t exist to take our jobs ! i ain t turnin queer"

"if our government is just gonna let anybody into our time who wants to come , then we have to take matters into our own hands"
"look , it sucks that the immigrants time is so crappy , but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time , then it s just gonna make our time crappy too"
"huh ? i mean , maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future , then , then the future won t be so bad , and , these immigrants won t need to come back here looking for work"
"if we build for a better future , the immigrants will stay there"
"we can start to make a difference if we want it for our children recycle that can and plant that tree , cause the future begins with you and me"
"garrision , if we change our mascot that means the eco terrorists win ! that s right , stanley , the eco terrorists win"

"if the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes cartman stole , then , does it matter that much ? it matters , stan"
"if these ballots are made public then the man that people voted for will be president , but he will no doubt keep star wars from the chinese and allow disney to keep it instead"

we all need to understand that troll trace will never happen if people don t log on to use it
it relies on people typing in a name and address of someone else to add to that database
"if we can all agree to resist the urge to look up other people s internet histories , maggie , okay ? as long as we all respect each other s privacy , darling , then our town won t suffer the same fate as fort collins"

"i m goin down to south park , gonna have myself a time friendly faces everywhere humble folks without temptation goin down to south park , gonna leave my woes behind ample parking day or night people spouting , howdy , neighbor ! heading on up to south park , gonna see if i can t unwind mrph rmhmhm rm ! mrph rmhmhm rm ! come on down to south park and meet some friends of mine mr"

"why is it that the school allows funding that only goes to speciala needs students ? are the rest of us not special ? if we are continually asked to work for no money and ask our parents to pay for our programs , then soon we will all be poor and forced to live in a trailer park , like theresa"
